Chapter 1. What's New
IPfolio releases introduce new features three times a year (Winter, Spring, Summer).
IPfolio Summer '25
Note: In case you need assistance setting up, configuring or using any of the below-described features,
please contact the IPfolio Premium Services Team.
Designs
Categories and Finance Tabs on Design Rights and Design Families
Categories and Finance tabs are now available on Design Rights and Design Families, making it possible to use the
Category Tree and add/track related costs on these records, just like on Patents, Trademarks, etc.
Design Right's Application Type Defaulted Based on Country
A new checkbox field Multiple Design Application is now available on Country records.
Page 7
| 1 - What's New
When creating new Design Rights, if this checkbox is enabled on the Country selected for the Design Right that is
being created, the Design Right's Application Type will be set to Multiple by default. Otherwise, it will be defaulted
to Single per Design.
Edit Classes When Creating Design Rights
When creating Design Rights from a Design Family, the Classes, automatically inherited from the Design Family,
can now be edited in the Create Design Rights window by double-clicking inside the Classes field or clicking on the 
pencil icon next to it.
The necessary changes can then be introduced on the Manage Classes screen that will open.
Page 8
IPfolio User Guide
Related Design Rights Displayed on Design Right Records
Thanks to our new Record Image List View Component (on page 15), you can now have an overview of the Design
Right records related to the current one, with their respective images in-line.
They are displayed under the Industrial Designs tab on Design Right records, and the sections shown vary 
depending on the Design Right's Application Type:
âª For Design Rights with Application Type=Single Per Design, a section called Other Applications in Design 
Family (Same Country) is available. It displays other Design Rights that belong to the same Design Family and
have the same Country as the current record.
âª For Design Rights with Application Type=Single with Selected Designs, two sections are available:
- Other Applications in Design Family (Same Country) - displaying other Design Rights that belong to the same
Design Family and have the same Country as the current record.
- Split from Design Right (if the current record has been split) - showing the Design Rights that were created as 
a result of splitting the current Design Right.
âª For Design Rights with Application Type=Multiple, a section called Other Design Rights in Multiple Design 
Application is included, listing all Design Rights from the same Multiple Design Application.
New Field 'Is Splitfrom Parent' on Design Right
A new checkbox field Is Splitfrom Parentis now available on Design Right records.
When using the Split Design Right functionality on a Design Right whose Application Type=Single with Selected 
Designs, this field gets automatically activated on all the created child records.
Page 9
| 1 - What's New
Also, the ParentID field gets populated with the ID of the parent Design Right on all the newly created records.
Finally, the Industrial Designs tab of the parent Design Right shows all the child records created as a result of 
splitting in the Split from Design Right section.
Refined Logic for Status (High-Level) on Design Family
The logic of the Status (High-Level) field on Design Family records has been updated as follows:
âª If at least one family member is In Force, the family is In Force;
âª If at least one family member is Pending, the family is Pending;
âª If all family members are Not Filed, the family is Not Filed;
âª If all family members are Lapsed, the family is Lapsed;
âª If all family members are Closed, the family is Closed;
âª If all family members are Sold, the family is Sold;
âª If the family members are a mix of at least two of the following statuses: Not Filed, Lapsed, Closed, or Sold, the 
family is Closed.
Filing Table on Design Family
You can now get an overview of the status of all Design Rights within a Design Family in a comprehensive filing table
under the Filings tab on Design Family records.
Page 10
IPfolio User Guide
The Status Color of each Design Right is also displayed.
Design Right Suffix Configuration
A Custom Metadata Type for controlling Design Right suffixes has been created: Setup> Custom Metadata Types > 
Design Right Suffix Configuration.
The suffixes assigned to Design Right IDs can be customized based on the Design Rightâs Relationship to Parent, 
e.g., âHAGâ for International Designs or âDIVâ for Divisionals.
Data Propagation
When creating Design Right records, certain fields are now copied to them from the Design Family/Multiple Design
Application records (depending on the way Design Rights are created), or from parent to child Design Rights.
For details please see Data Propagation (on page 353).
Designer Management
You can now
âª Add designers to Design Family records;
âª Add designers to Industrial Design records upon the latter's creation, selecting from the ones that already exist
on the related Design Family;
âª Have designers propagated to Design Rights from Industrial Designs.
Three new objects were introduced, and the corresponding Designer records are created at each step - Designer 
(Design Family), Designer (Industrial Design), and Designer.
For more details please see Designers (on page 354).
Create Subsequent Filings from Multiple Design Applications
You can create subsequent filings directly from Multiple Design Applications now.
Page 11
| 1 - What's New
For this, a new button - Create Child Records - has been introduced on Multiple Design Application records.
For details please see Creating Subsequent Filings from a Multiple Design Application (on page 347).
Email and Documents
Removal of 'Embed Images' Button in Create Email
The Embed Images button in the Create Email screen was removed to enhance the reliability of Email
communications. This update ensures that Emails sent will no longer include images that are not externally
accessible, preventing issues related to image rendering in external Email clients.
Page 12
IPfolio User Guide
Trademarks
'Create TM Filing Instruction' Renamed to 'Create Trademarks'
Following customer requests, we have replaced the Create TM Filing Instruction Quick Action button on 
Trademark records with Create Trademarks .
Approval Process Update for TM Filing Instructions
To support a more flexible and controlled trademark filing process, particularly for clients who assign filing tasks
to external law firms for review and approval, we have introduced a new checkbox: Instantly Process TM Filing 
Instructions. This setting is available in the Admin Panel under General Settings > Miscellaneous and is enabled by
default. While this checkbox is enabled, creating a new TM Filing Instruction via the Create Trademarks button on a 
Trademark will automatically update the following fields for TM Filing Instruction:
âª Status changes to Instruction Acknowledged.
âª Instruction Validation Date will be set to the current date.
âª Instructions Validated changes to true.
If the checkbox is disabled, Status will be set to New Filing Instructions, the Instruction Validation Date will remain 
empty, and Instructions Validated will be set to false.
Additionally, a mechanism will automatically initiate the Trademark creation process once the Status is Instruction 
Acknowledged, the Instruction Validation Date is filled, and Instructions Validated is set to true.
This update ensures that Trademarks are only created once instructions have been reviewed and approved.
TM View Integration For Trademarks
We have introduced a new field, View TM Details, that allows you to access Trademark information directly from a
matching TM View website. By clicking on the provided View TM Details link in a Trademark record, you can easily
access the relevant information. Matching is performed using a combination of the Country Code and Application
Number. If the Application Number is empty, the Registration Number will be used instead as the Application
Number.
Clicking the link leads you to a matching TM View database, making it easier for you to find Trademark records
based on the Application Number and Country Code.
The functionality supports multiple formats for Application Numbers, ensuring compatibility with various national 
and regional Trademark databases.
IP One Data
Introduction of 'Publication of Grant' Field for Patents
In response to the discrepancies observed in the synchronization process for Japanese patents, we have introduced
a new field named Publication of Grantfor Patent records. This field captures the date when the grant of the
patent is published, which is distinct from the grant date in some jurisdictions, such as Japan. The new field will be
automatically included in the relevant field sets for the Patent object.
Page 13
| 1 - What's New
IPsync
IPsync Available for India
IPsync functionality is now available for Patent records where Country=IN.
For the Indian patents' Application Number formats accepted by the system please see Application Number 
Formats (on page 295).
Category Tree
Filtering Outthe Last Selected Category on the Category Tree
In reports, you can now identify the final node selected on the record's Category Tree and do the corresponding
filtering using a checkbox field Selected Category. It is available on all Categorization records - IDF Categorization,
Categorization, TM Categorization, Patent Family Categorization, Trademark Family Categorization, etc.
If checked, it indicates this is the last Category (or one of the same-level Categories) selected on the record's
Category Tree; if unchecked, it indicates there are nodes selected below.
IP Portal
User-Contact-Party Linking Refined
When creating a User, the system now correctly creates the associated Party and Contact records. It also
establishes the necessary links between User and Contact, as well as Contact and Party as follows:
For Lightning Portal users:
âª A User is created with a license other than Customer Portal Manager.
âª A Contact is created and the Portal ContactId custom field on the User record is populated with the Contact Id.
âª A Party is created and the Contact custom lookup field is populated with the Contact Id of the above-mentioned
Contact.
For other Portal users (Basic, Stepwise, VF-Based, SLDS):
âª A User is created with the Customer Portal Manager license.
âª A Contact is created and the Contact standard field on the User record is populated with the Contact Id.
âª A Party is created and the Contact custom lookup field on the Party record is populated with the Contact Id of
the above-mentioned Contact.
Page 14
IPfolio User Guide
Relationships between a User and a Contact, and a Party and a Contact, are always created/updated when a User is
created/updated for all Portals and on individual records in the system.
The matching of Users with Contacts or Parties is based on the Use EmployeeID for matching setting (Admin Panel
> Portal Settings > Use EmployeeID for matching):
âª When enabled, the User's employee number is used to find the related Contact and Party.
âª When disabled, the User's Email is used to find the related Contact and Party.
Lightning Document Tree in IP Portal
The document tree is now available in the IP Portal. Folders where the Visible on Portal setting is enabled in the 
context menu will be displayed if they contain at least one attachment. It is not possible to add new folders from
inside the portal to the document tree.
New Conflict Fields for IP Portal Compatibility
Three new packaged fields have been added to the Conflict object:
âª Submission Date
âª Submitted By
âª Status
The new fields simplify the submission process of Contracts through the IP Portal.
Other Improvements
Record Image List View Component
You can now benefit from our new custom component that displays records with their related images in-line.
While rendering records just like other list views (one per row), Record Image List View additionally searches for 
any images (.jpg, .png, .tiff) referenced as related Documents on these records and displays them in-line for a better
visualization.
You can drag and drop these images within the same row to alter the order in which they are displayed, these
changes being saved across users. This way, the visual representation of these images can also tell a story of the
recordâs progress or clarify priorities.
Additionally, the component can display a list of records, along with the images, related to a given record. This
is especially useful if the parent record does not hold the images itself, or if the interaction with them should be
performed on a child record.
Page 15
| 1 - What's New
This functionality is currently available only in the Design module - e.g., showing the records related to the current
Design Right under the Industrial Designs tab - but can be implemented for other modules in the future.
Note: This is a custom Lightning component, not a standard list view enhancement. It can be added to any
Lightning Record Page, but not to standard list views.
Customizable Prosecution Status on Patents, Trademarks and Design Rights
You can now control and customize the logic of setting Status (Prosecution) on Patent, Trademark and Design Right
records.
For this, we have introduced new Admin Panel settings (Admin Panel > General Settings > Miscellaneous> Status 
(Prosecution) Configuration):
Three formula fields for defining the status calculation logic on Patents, Trademarks and Design Rights:
âª Status (Prosecution) Logic - PAT
âª Status (Prosecution) Logic - TM
âª Status (Prosecution) Logic - DR
And three respective checkbox fields for activating the custom logic calculation for these records:
Page 16
IPfolio User Guide
âª Enable Status (Prosecution) Logic - PAT
âª Enable Status (Prosecution) Logic - TM
âª Enable Status (Prosecution) Logic - DR
Example: To apply custom logic to Patent's Status (Prosecution), fill in the Status (Prosecution) Logic - PAT field with 
the necessary formula and activate Enable Status (Prosecution) Logic - PAT. Next time you update a Patent record,
its Status (Prosecution) will be recalculated in accordance with the formula you introduced in Status (Prosecution) 
Logic - PAT.
Record Sequence Form Component
Following the need to standardize the process of record creation and sequencing, a new custom Lightning
component - Record Sequence Form - has been introduced.
Designed to eventually replace the standard New action, it has been already implemented for the Design Module 
and can now be applied to any IPfolio record.
To override the standard New action with this component,
1. Open the configuration page of the necessary object - e.g., Patent (Setup> Object Manager> Patent).
2. Click Buttons, Links, and Actions in the menu on the left.
3. Find the New button, click the down arrow on the right and select Edit.
4. Select the Lightning component option for Lightning Experience Override and Mobile Override and 
choose IPfolio:SequenceRecordFormWrapper from the dropdowns on the right for both.
5. Click Save.
Page 17
| 1 - What's New
A new field set Display on Record Sequence Form has also been created and introduced on the Design Module 
objects. It includes the fields to be shown in the new component - on the form displayed when creating new records.
You can manually add the field set to the object you would like to use the component for.
Please note that to be able to customize the sequencing format, you need to create an associated Object Setting
record for the object in question. If the object does not have a related Object Setting record, the suggested ID will
be created using the first three letters of the object name, e.g., IND-00001 for Industrial Designs. If the object has an 
associated Object Setting record with a defined sequencing format, the suggested ID will use it instead.
Total Cost Rollup Update
The latest update introduces a new field for the calculation of total costs: Total Cost(calculated) .
The field is now available for Domain Name Family, Trademark Family, Patent Review, and Review. This update 
also adds lookup fields to these objects within the Cost object, enabling more accurate tracking and management of
expenses.
This improvement ensures that users can easily monitor and manage costs across different record types.
Iprova Integration
The integration of Iprovaâs Invention Studio 3 with IPfolio allows for the seamless transfer of invention disclosures
directly into IPfolio.
Invention Studio 3 is a powerful, data-driven invention platform designed for R&D, innovation, and IP teams. It helps
to identify high-value areas of technological disruption and create inventions faster and more efficiently. Over 1.500
patents were filed using Iprovaâs technology. Patents based on inventions created by Iprova are cited by all 10 of the
world's largest technology companies.
The integration with IPfolio allows you to:
Page 18
IPfolio User Guide
âª Submit invention disclosures directly from Invention Studio 3 into IPfolio via a secure API.
âª Manage disclosures using IPfolioâs tools like online review meetings, configurable scorecards, and invention
screening.
âª Improve innovation processes and maximize the potential for patentable subject matter.
Iprova enhances collaboration between inventors and IP teams, thereby facilitating the sharing and refining of
inventions and ideas.
To learn more about Iprova and how this integration can benefit your team, please reach out to Stephanie Dockus.
Inventor Clone Fields for Child Records
A new field set, Inventor Clone Fields, was added to the Inventor object. This field set allows users to define which 
local and custom fields should be automatically copied from the originating Patent record when a new Inventor
record is created as part of that Patent. This ensures that key inventor-related data is consistently carried over
during the creation of new Patent records that include Inventors.
Duplicate Party Names in PatentInventors: Logic Refinement
It was reported that when creating a Patent from an IDF, the case creation would fail if there existed a Party with
the same name as the Inventorâs, but a different Email address.
The logic has been refined, and now Patent creation is not always prevented by same-name Parties with different
Emails or Employee IDs, the system behavior being regulated by the Use EmployeeID for matching setting (Admin 
Page 19
| 1 - What's New
Panel > Portal Settings > Use EmployeeID for matching) and the Prevent_Duplicate_Party_Names Duplicate Rule 
(Setup> Duplicate Rules> Prevent_Duplicate_Party_Names).
For details please see Duplicate Party Names in Patent Inventors (on page 240).
General Salesforce Enhancements
Improved List Views Dropdown Menu
The list views dropdown menu was updated to improve accessibility and provide a more consistent user experience.
The new dropdown menu, now available for all objects, displays up to 100 lists and includes a search option for
easier navigation. With this new feature, you can quickly find and access your list views.
IPfolio Spring '25

Note: If you need help migrating your design-related data from other IPfolio modules, please contact the
IPfolio Premium Services Team.
Category Tree
AI-Driven Categorization for Patents
Benefit from the AI-driven categorization for your patents.
Page 21
| 1 - What's New
Triggered by a manual or scheduled IP One Data sync, the system now assigns Patent records to the existing
Categories or, if necessary, creates new ones, providing accurate and automated classification.
AI Classifications are automatically added and displayed on the Categories tab of Patent records. You can also
remove AI Classifications from your Category Trees by clicking x next to them.
To start using the functionality, first activate it on the Admin Panel by setting Use AI Taxonomies to true: Admin 
Panel > Integrations > IP One> Use AI Taxonomies.
Recreate Category Trees Using BLET
We have introduced a new Business Execution Logic Tool option â Generate Missing Categorization Data â that 
lets you bulk fix missing Category Tree nodes.
Currently available for Patents and Trademarks, it updates the existing Categorizations and creates parent nodes
for orphan child Categories in the Category Tree without creating duplicates, i.e. respecting the already available
correct nodes.
Page 22
IPfolio User Guide
New Duplicate Rule Preventing Duplicate Category Names
Following the enhancement of the Category Tree logic in terms of creating same-name Categories (on page 44), 
a new Duplicate Rule Prevent Duplicate Category Names (Same-Parent Categories) has now been activated. The 
preceding one â Prevent_Duplicate_Category_Names â has been deactivated and removed.
Email and Documents
Email Window Can Now Be Expanded By Default
We have introduced a new Admin Panel setting that lets you configure the Email window opening when Create 
Email is clicked: Admin Panel > General Settings > Email Settings> Use Expanded Size Email Window.
When Use Expanded Size Email Window is enabled, the Email window will be maximized by default and open in
an expanded size each time the Create Email button is clicked. When the setting is deactivated, it will open in a
compact size at the bottom right, like it did before.
Updates to 'Include Related Documents' Functionality
The custom setting Include Related Documents displays all documents from Invention Disclosures in the Document
Tree of a related Patent/Patent Family when enabled. It now also supports merged Invention Disclosures.
Additionally, all documents originating from the Invention Disclosure are grouped inside a separate folder.
Page 23
| 1 - What's New
For more information please see Displaying Related Attachments in the Document Tree (on page 182).
Email Recipient Suggestions Available on More Records Now
You can now include Email addresses from lookup fields in the Email Recipient Suggestion List field set on the 
following objects:
âª Invention Disclosure
âª Patent
âª Patent Family
âª Trademark Search Request
âª Trademark
âª Trademark Family
âª IP Contract
âª Conflict
âª General Matter
For Party lookups, the values of the Email1, Email2 and Email3 fields are then listed as suggestions (if available). For
User and Contact lookups, the value of the Email field is suggested.
'Document Date' Remains Blank on an Email Draft Untilthe Email Is Sent
Previously, Document Date would get populated on an Email draft once the draft was created and wouldn't update
to reflect the date when the Email was actually sent. To avoid the confusion, Document Date stays blank on Email
drafts now and is only set when the document is sent.
HTML Email Template Management Tips
Since our Email solution leverages Salesforce's Input Rich Text Lightning Web Component, the formatting of the
Email body (further sent Email) might differ from that defined in the HTML Email template.
To prevent some of the formatting issues, please refer here: Lightning Web Component: Input Rich Text.
Also, to ensure consistent spacing between what is presented in the LWC and what is defined in the HTML Email
Template, we recommend that you use the <br/> tag instead of <p>.

Improved Error Handling for Duplicate Non-Patent Citations
If you try to add a citation that already exists in the system, you will now receive a clear error message:
Additionally, the process for adding non-patent citations has been improved. You are now required to perform a
search before creating a new citation. This change helps prevent duplicate entries and ensures efficiency.
'Link to PTO 2' Field on Patent: Canadian and Australian Patent Offices Included
We have expanded the functionality of the Link to PTO 2 field on Patent records to include the links to the Canadian
Intellectual Property Office and IP Australia.
Now if the Patent's Country is CA or AU, IPfolio uses Application Number to combine values from the record with the 
Canadian Patents Database or Australian Patent Search Tool respectively (when possible).
Note: Application Number must be in the following format: nnnnnnn (7 numeric digits for the official 
number) for CA records, and yyyynnnnnn (4 digits for the year and 6 numeric digits for the official number)
for AU records.
'Link to Derwent' Field on Patent Also Considers Patent Number Now
Previously, the Patent's Link to Derwent field was populated based on Country Code and Publication Number. 
Since there are records where Publication Number is missing and only Patent Number is present, we have modified
the Derwent link to consume Patent Number in case Publication Number is unavailable.
'FirstIssue Date' Not Copied from an IDF to a Patent Family Anymore
In the past, when using Approve for Filing on an Invention Disclosure, the First Issue Date value would copy over to
a newly created Patent Family, making it look like there already was a Patent issued within this Family.
This has now been fixed, and First Issue Date is not copied over from an IDF to a Patent Family anymore.
Trademarks
Page 25
| 1 - What's New
Trademarks Created for National Filing Countries Using TMFI Inherit Classes & Goods from the
Base Trademark
Previously, when using Create TM Filing Instruction, only Trademarks created for WIPO Filing Countries would
inherit Classes & Goods from the Base Trademark. Now Classes & Goods are also copied over to the Trademarks
created for National Filing Countries.
Note: If Claim Priority is checked, Classes & Goods are propagated to national filings from the Priority
Trademark.
'Watched Trademark' Field Implementation
The Watched Trademark field has been introduced for Watch Orders. It is populated with the name of the watched 
Trademark when syncing Watch Orders from CompuMark. This ensures that every Watch Order is linked to the
correct Trademark, even if the Trademark doesnât already exist in IPfolio.
'Search RequestID' Now Copied to a Trademark Created from a Trademark Family
When creating a Trademark from a Trademark Family, the value of the Trademark Family's Search Request ID field 
is now copied to the Trademark's Trademark Search Request field.
An exception is when Search Request ID is included in the Skip copy same name fields field set â in this case, it's not 
copied over.
CompuMark
Page 26
IPfolio User Guide
Improved Trademark Content Updates
We have added a new field, Record Last Updated (CompuMark), to provide more accurate Trademark content.
This field displays the date when the Trademark content was last updated by CompuMark. This helps to resolve
discrepancies between CompuMark Sync results and local agent information. By displaying the last updated date
from the CompuMark API, you can now easily verify the most recent changes.
IP One Data
New Fields on Publication
We have added new fields on Publication records to enhance data accuracy and completeness based on user
feedback. They are automatically populated with data from the IP One Data feed:
âª Application Number: Stores the reference number assigned by the patent office when the application is filed.
âª Filing Date: Records the date accorded to an application when filing requirements are fulfilled.
âª Status: Stores the current status of the patent.
âª Legal Status: Records the latest legal status description based on the most recent event.
New Image Retrieval Feature for IP One Data
Previously, after syncing a record with IP One Data, a record image was fetched from Espacenet. IPfolio now
retrieves drawings directly from IP One Data and automatically stores these images within the Drawings folder in 
the Document Tree. The first page clipping image is set as the record image. This functionality can be easily toggled
on or off via the Admin Panel under Integrations > IP One> Retrieve Drawings from IP One.
IP One Data Status Field Mapping Update
A new field mapping was introduced. The Legal Status field from IP One Data is now mapped to the Status Text
(Detailed) field on Patents. Status Text(Detailed) is subsequently updated with the latest Legal Code Description, 
for instance: LAPSED DUE TO FAILURE TO PAY MAINTENANCE FEE. The Legal Code Description is extracted from the IP
One Data record with the latest publication date.
The field Status Text(Detailed) was added to the Update Without Sync Log field set.
Annuities/Renewals
Manage Renewal-Related Data Audits That Need Manual Review
Generally, when you use Data Audit records to accept or discard discrepancies retrieved with the renewals data
verification service, updates happen automatically. However, there are cases where manual review is required.
Page 27
| 1 - What's New
You can now identify those by the 'Manual Review' prefix in the Field Name column in the Data Audits list view.
When trying to accept them â whether in bulk or individually â you will be prompted to manually review the
discrepancies on individual record pages.
To support this functionality, we have also introduced a new Admin Panel field Additional Discrepancy Fields 
(Admin Panel > Integrations > Payment Service > Additional Discrepancy Fields), where the fields that require 
manual review can be stipulated. Its current default values are Case and Classes, additional values can be added in 
future.
Projected Total Costs Calculation Adjustment
When comparing the Projected Total Cost field value on the Renewal/Maintenance record to the figures retrieved
by the renewal data verification team, a misalignment was spotted.
The issue proved to be connected with the mapping of the IPfolio Projected Claims Fee field with the renewal 
service and has been fixed. The field value is now successfully imported to IPfolio, also bringing the projected total
costs into alignment.
Renewal-Related Data Audits for 'Earliest Priority Date'
Renewal-related Data Audits are now created for the Earliest Priority Date field on Patents and Trademarks. They
are available for accepting/discarding, just like other discrepancies retrieved by the renewals data verification team.
E-Correspondence
Page 28
IPfolio User Guide
E-Correspondence for EPO Documents
Use the E-Correspondence functionality to now also upload and process documents from the European Patent
Office.
Bulk E-Submission to JPO
Using the E-Submission feature, you can now request the creation of submission packages for Japan Patent Office
for up to 200 cases at once.
Other Improvements
Filing Date Updates for Japanese and Hong Kong Applications upon IP One Data Syncs
We have refined the handling of filing dates for Japanese and Hong Kong applications upon IP One Data syncs.
The system now updates Local Filing Date â not Filing Date â for child Patents whose Country is JP and the 
Relationship to Parentis Divisional (like for all non-US cases (on page 756)).
Page 29
| 1 - What's New
If the child Patent's Country is set to HK and the Relationship to Parent is Confirmation of Foreign Registration, 
Local Filing Date is updated instead of Filing Date as well.
This ensures the correct calculation of the patent's expiration date.
User-Contact-Party Linking Refined
Following the Winter '25 implementations (on page 47) ensuring the proper User-Contact-Party linking upon
creating a new User record on the IP Portal, we have further refined the matching functionality.
When a Party is matched to a Contact, the Use EmployeeID for matching custom setting is taken into account.
When it's enabled, the matching is based on the Employee ID, otherwise â on the Email.
CRM Analytics: Portfolio Age Dashboard
Track the total number of active patents each year and observe how your portfolio changes over time with the Age
Dashboard.
Login Flow for Portal Users
A new login flow for portal users is available. When you log in, you are prompted to update your contact details.
Administrators can control the frequency of this login prompt through custom settings. Once the update is
completed, you are redirected to the portal home page. If you would like this functionality configured for you, please
contact the IPfolio Premium Services Team.

IPfolio User Guide
New fields for Advanced Task Management
We have introduced new fields to improve the management of Task Definitions and Task Option Definitions.
The new fields include:
âª Workflow Name (for Task Definition): A workflow name field has been added to group Task Definitions. 
By assigning the same Workflow Name when creating a Task Definition, you can simplify the reporting and
management of Task Definitions within the same workflow.
âª External ID (for both objects): External ID fields have been introduced for Task Definition and Task Option
Definition details, making it easier to reference these fields during imports.
New Filters for Patents on Portfolio Explorer
Two new filters for Patents have been added to the Portfolio Explorer:
âª Provisional
âª Parent Title
General Salesforce Enhancements

Edit List Filters Option Is No Longer Available
The Edit List Filters option in List Views Control has now been removed for all list views.
To amend your list view filters, please click the Filters icon instead.
Capture More Data with the Increased Limit of Custom Fields for Activities
Salesforce orgs with fewer than 400 million activities can now capture even more details about their sales
processes, thanks to an increased limit of 300 custom fields â tripling the previous limit of 100.
Page 32
IPfolio User Guide
Brand the Welcome Email for Internal Users
You can now customize the welcome email that internal users receive when they first access your Salesforce
org - e.g., modify the look of the email to suit your brand, or change the text of the email to include onboarding
instructions that are specific to your company.
This feature was delivered thanks to user ideas on IdeaExchange.
IPfolio Winter '25
Note: In case you need assistance setting up, configuring or using any of the below-described features,
please contact the IPfolio Premium Services Team.
Email and Documents
Document Tree Enhancementfor Related Attachments
Retrieve Related Invention Disclosure IDs
Attachments linked to Invention Disclosures in the Document Tree of a related patent can now be automatically
displayed.
For that, we have introduced a new configuration setting for the Document Tree feature. This update allows you to
include or exclude associated documents in the Document Tree based on a new field, Include Related Documents. 
By default, this setting is disabled, but you can enable it to view related documents within the tree structure. For
details please see: Displaying Related Attachments in the Document Tree (on page 182)
New Document Source Column
A new Document Source column was added to the Document Tree. It indicates whether the document is associated
with an IP Right or an Invention Disclosure, providing better context for document origins.
Improved Email Recipient Suggestions
Email recipient suggestions can now include local fields from custom lookups on core objects such as Patent,
IDF, and Trademark. Email addresses from these custom fields are then part of the recipient suggestion list when
creating Emails. When you start typing in the To, Cc, or Bcc fields in the Email creation window, the suggestion
list includes Email field values from these custom lookups. For details please see: Creating an Email Recipient 
Suggestion List (on page 197).
Page 33
| 1 - What's New
New Custom Email Subject Fields
We have introduced a new feature that allows administrators to customize Email subject lines for Invention
Disclosure and Trademark Search Request objects. This update enables the use of a specific fieldâs value as the Email
subject instead of the default case ID. Administrators can configure this setting in the Admin Panel under the Email 
Settings (on page 196) tab.
By using a field that better represents the content or context of the Email, you can quickly identify and manage
Emails more efficiently.
Document Cloning Update
Users encountered errors when attempting to clone documents on custom objects other than Patents and
Trademarks. To resolve this, we have removed the clone option for unsupported objects, ensuring users no longer
experience these errors.
Improved Document Attachment Management
We have updated the process for managing attachments and their associated documents. Now, when an attachment
is deleted, all related files are also removed. This update ensures that all related files are deleted together,
preventing orphaned files and improving storage efficiency.
This change covers various scenarios, including removing attachments from the Document Tree, Email drafts, and
templates. It also applies to bulk deletions and documents retrieved with IPsync, ensuring a comprehensive and
efficient document management system.
Document Tree Title Update Fix
We have resolved an issue where file titles were not updating correctly in the Document Tree after being changed in
the File Details. Previously, when users updated a fileâs title via the File Details option, the change was not reflected
in the Document Tree, causing inconsistencies. With this fix, any title changes made through the File Details will
now be accurately displayed in the Document Tree.
Filing Strategy
Filing Strategy Costs
We have introduced a new feature that allows you to add estimated costs for each stage of an IPâs lifecycle in a filing
country. This enhancement helps businesses use this information when selecting a Filing Strategy for an invention.
The costs and sum of costs are displayed on the Filing Strategy - Countries tab and during the application of a Filing
Strategy. Phase costs are displayed below each phase, and total costs are shown at the top of the page. If no cost
data is available, the message Estimated Costs: Not Configured is shown. Only relevant and up-to-date information
Page 34
IPfolio User Guide
is presented. The costs and total costs are updated dynamically when countries are added or removed. For details
please see: Filing Strategy Costs (on page 258).
Provisional Patent Application Indicator
You can now easily identify if a country has a provisional patent application.
A new indicator displays a discrete (prov) text next to the country name, making it straightforward to see which
countries have provisional patent applications.
Create Patentfor Patent Family
Filing Strategies now include support for the Create Patent button on the Patent Family. This improvement lets you
automatically populate the Country field based on the first phase of the Filing Strategy. If multiple Countries are 
involved, you can save and create new patents without closing the modal.
This update simplifies the patent creation process, ensuring that all necessary information is pre-filled and reducing 
the time required to create multiple patents. You can now manage patent filings more effectively, with a clear
summary of the Filing Strategy displayed for better understanding and tracking.
Page 35
| 1 - What's New
IDF Lock Logic Adapted
We have updated the logic for locking Invention Disclosure Forms (IDFs). The lock mechanism originally ensured
that once an IDF reached critical statuses, it could not be modified, maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the
information during the patenting process.
Now, IDFs will only be locked if a related Patent Family record exists. This change ensures that IDFs remain editable
until a Patent Family is created, reducing unnecessary delays. This update improves the workflow by allowing you to
continue editing IDFs without interruption until the necessary records are in place.
Invention Disclosures
Invention Screening Widget Configuration
We have updated the Invention Screening widget to allow users to configure the search query fields. Previously, the
widget was limited to a fixed set of fields, but now you can customize which fields are included in the search query
by adapting a new field set. The field set is called Invention Screening Fields. The default fields included in the field 
set are Title, Short Description, Problem Solved, Novel Features, Advantages, and Disadvantages.
Page 36
IPfolio User Guide
Inventors from All Related IDFs Added to the New Patent When Using 'Approve for Filing'
Now, when using Approve for Filing on an Invention Disclosure, all Inventors from both the primary Invention
Disclosure and all the associated Invention Disclosures in the Merged IDFs related list are copied over to the newly
created Patent (previously only Inventors from the primary IDF would get copied).
Update to Cited References Symbols
We have updated the IDS matrix to include new symbols for additional reference types in the Cited References
section. The new reference types and their corresponding symbols are Specification Citation (green), SR Citation 
(blue), ISR Citation (blue), EESR Citation (blue), Third Party Citation (purple), Opponent Citation (purple), and Patent
Proprietor Citation (green). Existing symbols for To be Cited (orange), Applicant Citation (green), Examiner Citation
(blue) and Wonât Cite (white) remain unchanged.
IDF Status Update Logic Changed
Previously, when using Approve for Filing on an Invention Disclosure that already had related Patents and was in
the Patent(s) Filed status, the IDF's Status would change back to Approved for Filing.
This has been fixed, and now when using Approve for Filing on an Invention Disclosure that has related Patents/the
Filing Date of its related Patents is populated, the IDF's status is not reset.
Patents
Extended Functionality for Pharma Customers: Patent Term Extensions
In addition to Supplementary Protection Certificates, IPfolio lets you manage Patent Term Extensions now:
âª SPC Start Date and SPC End Date fields have been renamed to SPC/PTE Start Date and SPC/PTE End Date.
âª The logic for recalculating SPC/PTE Start Date (Maximum Term + 1 day) has been extended to trigger the
updates when Relationship to Parent is Supplementary Protection Certificate or Patent Term Extension.
âª A new Admin Panel setting has been introduced: Admin Panel > General Settings > Miscellaneous> Enable 
SPC/PTE Status Logic Calculation. If enabled (and Relationship to Parent is Supplementary Protection 
Page 37
| 1 - What's New
Certificate or Patent Term Extension) the special Status logic is triggered (for details please see Status (HighLevel) and Status (Prosecution)).
âª The Copy when creating SPC child records field set has been renamed to Copy when creating SPC or PTE child
records, its logic being accordingly adapted:
Now when Patents where Relationship to Parent is Patent Term Extension are created using the Create Child 
Records functionality, the Filing Date, Earliest Priority Date and Earliest Priority Number are copied over from
parent to child records, just as they do for SPC records.
'Relationship to Parent' Picklist Values Aligned on Patent and Patent Parent
If previously several Relationship to Parent picklist values were missing on Patent Parent as compared to the same
field on Patent, they have now been aligned and are in sync.
The only picklist value purposefully absent on the Patent's field (and present on Patent Parent) is Terminal 
Disclaimer.
For details please see Patent: Relationship to Parent (on page 784) and Patent Parent: Relationship to Parent (on
page 809).
Patent Family Status Updates Properly
The issue where the Family Status field on Patent Family wouldn't get recalculated once the new Patent record(s)
were linked to a Patent Family has been resolved.
Now Family Status gets updated both in case of the status change of the Patents already related to the Family, and if
new ones are linked to it.
In case all the Patents related to the Family are removed, Family Status changes to Not Filed.
New Field 'Link to Google Patents' on Third Party Patent
A formula field Link to Google Patents has been added on Third Party Patents.
It uses the same logic as the same-named field on Patents.
Page 38
IPfolio User Guide
New Object'Third Party Patentto 3rd Party Pat Link'
A new object â Third Party Patent to 3rd Party Pat Link â has been created for relating Third Party Patents to other
Third Party Patents.
Trademarks
Refined Logic for Updating 'Cancelled/Abandoned Date' on Child Records Whose Parent's
Country Is WO
The logic for updating the children's Cancelled/Abandoned Date based on the changes of this field on their parent 
whose Country=WO has been adapted as follows:
âª If Cancelled/Abandoned Date is updated on a WO parent record, and it is the same or blank on its child 
Trademarks, Cancelled/Abandoned Date gets updated on the child records to match that of the parent.
âª If Cancelled/Abandoned Date is updated on a WO parent record, and it is different on its child Trademarks, it will 
stay unchanged on the child records upon parent updates.
Exclusion Countries Error Message Fixed
It was reported that when using Create TM Filing Instruction and trying to create a record in one of the countries 
mentioned in the Exclusion Countries (on page 721) field on the IP Contract linked to the Trademark, a proper
error message explaining the essence of the issue wouldn't pop up.
This has been resolved, and now the relevant error message is displayed in the above-described situation.
Always Require Sync Log Option for Class & Goods
A new method to process Data Audits for Class & Goods was introduced. The All Classes field was made available in
the Always Require Sync Log field set.
When the All Classes field is added to the Always Require Sync Log field set, and a Class & Goods update takes
place, this will always create a Data Audit.
Conversely, if the field is added to the Update without Sync Log field set, and a Class & Goods update takes place, a
Data Audit will still be displayed, but with Accept as the standard status.
In cases where the field is added to both or neither field sets, the logic related to Always Require Sync Log will take
precedence, treating the field as if it were in the Always Require Sync Log field set.
Additionally, when the CompuMark Sync button is clicked from a Trademark, any incoming changes from Class & 
Goods will now incorporate the new approach.
Page 39
| 1 - What's New
Improved Propagation of Categories from Parentto Child Trademarks/from Trademark Family
to Trademark
With this release, we have refined the propagation of Categories from parent to child Trademarks and from
Trademark Family to Trademark. For details please see the Category Tree (on page 43) section.
CompuMark
Permission Update
The IP Superuser Permission Set now includes Edit Access for the Next Renewal Date (CompuMark) field 
(previously restricted to Read-Only).
This change ensures that users with IP Superuser permissions can accept Data Audits for this field without any
issues.
CompuMark Data Sync Update
New data fields were added to the CompuMark API sync, allowing users to view additional trademark information
directly within IPfolio.
The new fields include Renewal Date, Next Renewal Date, Expiry Date, and Representative Information.
Improved Party Management
When accepting large volumes of Data Audits with similar party names, automatic party creation was triggered,
leading to duplicated records. This happened because the system did not take into account case differences in party
names, treating 'Example Party' and 'example party' as distinct entries. We now prevent the creation of duplicate
Party records when accepting Data Audits.
CompuMark Sync Update for WIPO Child Records
We have implemented a solution to correct WIPO child records that were populated with incorrect data. This
update ensures that the CompuMark ID from the parent WO record is accurately copied to the child records.
Additionally, a CompuMark sync has been run for all affected records to ensure data consistency.
IPsync
Inactive Patents and Trademarks Not Synced Anymore
If previously IPsync would run on cases no matter what their status was, now Patents and Trademarks in the Closed, 
Lapsed, or Sold (+ Finally Lapsed for Patents) status are not synced, and their statuses stay unchanged.
This prevents situations where, for example, a Patent in the Sold (inactive) status, which is still active on the PTO
side, gets its Issue Date updated upon IPsync and changes the Status (High-Level) to Issued.
Page 40
IPfolio User Guide
Additional Application Number Formatfor Taiwan Design Cases
In addition to (y)yy3nnnnn (e.g., 102301363), the following application number format is now supported for TW
Design cases: (y)yy3nnnnnDnn (e.g., 102301363D01), IPsync working properly in both situations.
For the full list of the preferred application number formats please see Application Number Formats (on page 295).
Patent's Entity Status Updates Properly Now
The issue where the Entity Status (on page 753) field on Patents would not get updated upon IPsync run or when
using the IPsync button has been fixed, and now it is successfully recalculated.
Annuities/Renewals
Data Audit Sync Log Enhancement
A Data Audit Sync Log is triggered when the value of the Pay field on TM Renewal or Renewal/Maintenance is set to 
No.
This also applies when the value of the Maintenance Status field is set to Inactive. The system automatically 
captures and logs these changes for future reference.
Improved Renewal Date Calculation
We have enhanced the process for calculating the next renewal date for Patents. This change pertains to the field
Next Renewal (Calculated).
Invoice Detail Rollup Update
An important enhancement to the invoice detail rollup process for Clarivate Renewals customers has been
implemented. We have addressed issues where multiple invoices for the same renewal were not correctly
summarized, leading to potential confusion and errors in financial reporting. The new update ensures that all invoice
details are accurately reported and rolled up to reflect the actual values for each Payment Service Unique ID.
Category Tree
Bulk Update for Patent Categories
We have introduced a new feature that allows you to bulk update Patent Categories in a more user-friendly manner.
This update eliminates the need to delete and create Categorization records manually using the import tool.
You can now easily add, change, or remove Categories for multiple Patent records directly from a single screen. This
functionality simplifies the categorization process significantly.
Page 41
| 1 - What's New
For more details please see Bulk Update Categories for Patents (on page 174).
'Show More' Link Now Configurable on Synchronous Category Tree
The Show More link has now been made configurable on the Synchronous Category Tree (like it is on the
Asynchronous Category Tree).
Since the Synchronous Tree is generally used for smaller Trees, it was previously limited to ten Categories. However,
this posed inconveniences for some customers who had more Categories in a Tree and would want them to be
shown right away, without additionally clicking Show More.
Now the link is configurable, and the number of Categories to be displayed to the user can be adapted.
Async Category Tree Can Now Be Auto Expanded
There is now a new property enabling the asynchronous Category Tree auto expand during rendering.
If Auto Expand is enabled, the first level and selected nodes are expanded when the tree is rendered, and it looks like
the synchronous Category Tree.
If Auto Expand is disabled, all the nodes are collapsed.
Page 42
IPfolio User Guide
Categorizations Properly Copied from Parentto Child Trademarks When Using 'Create TM Filing
Instruction'
Copying of Categories from parent to child Trademarks when using Create TM Filing Instruction functions properly 
now in accordance with the following logic:
Base Trademark Null Base Trademark Not Null
Priority 
Trademark 
Null
Copy Categorizations from Source Trademark to National Trademarks, International Trademarks, WO Copy Categorizations from Source to 
National Trademarks
Copy Categorizations from Base Trademark to International Trademarks, WO

Copy Categorizations from Source Trademarkto International Trademarks, WO
Copy Categorizations from Priority Trademark to National Trademarks
Copy Categorizations from Priority 
Trademark to National Trademarks
Copy Categorizations from Base Trademark to International Trademarks, WO
Categories Copy Down From Trademark Family to Trademark
The issue where Categories wouldn't copy down from Trademark Family to Trademark when using the Create 
Trademark functionality has been fixed.
Now when a new Trademark is created from a Trademark Family that has some Categories selected, those are
inherited to the newly created record.
Rendering Single-/Multi-Select Category Tree
The logic of rendering single-/multi-select Category Trees has been updated and is as follows now:
âª If all the Category Types visible in the Category Tree are single-select, they are shown as single-select.
âª A Categorization record is now created for every node marked on the single-select Category Tree â including
parent categories throughout the entire hierarchy.
âª If the Category Tree contains a combination of single-select and multi-select Category Types, it is displayed as
multi-select.
Page 43
| 1 - What's New
Refined Logic for Same-Name Categories
The Category Tree logic in terms of creating same-name Categories has been adapted and functions as follows now:
It is impossible to create
âª Two Categories with the same name and without a Parent Category within the same Category Type (e.g.,
Category Type = Pharmaceutical, Category Name = API).
âª Two Categories with the same name and the same Parent Category within the same Category Type (e.g.,
Category Type = Pharmaceutical, Parent Category = Formulation, Category Name = Capsule).
It is possible to create
âª Two Categories with the same name if they have a different Parent Category (e.g., [Category Type =
Pharmaceutical, Parent Category = Formulation, Category Name = Capsule] and [Category Type =
Pharmaceutical, Parent Category = API, Category Name = Capsule]).
âª Two Categories with the same name if they have a different Category Type (e.g., [Category Type =
Pharmaceutical, Category Name = API] and [Category Type = Software, Category Name = API]).
âª Two Categories with the same name if they have a Parent Category with the same name but in a different
Category Type (e.g., [Category Type = Pharmaceutical, Parent Category = Formulation, Category Name =
Capsule] and [Category Type = Software, Parent Category = Formulation, Category Name = Capsule]).
E-Correspondence
E-Correspondence Extended Support
The E-Correspondence functionality now also supports uploading and processing documents from the World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and PCT applications.

Other Improvements
All Fields on All Objects Available for Selection in All Field Sets
All fields on all objects are available for selection in all field sets now.
Adding Japanese Language Support for Online Help
An additional URL was added to support users who have set Japanese as their language, allowing them to access the
User Guide in Japanese.
Users with Japanese set as their language will be redirected to the Japanese version of the User Guide when they
click on the User Guide link on the homepage. It is also possible to switch back to the full English version of the User
Guide if needed.
Please note that the User Guide in Japanese is continuously being expanded, and not all sections are currently
available in Japanese.
New Lighting Record Page Template For Proper Image Sizing
A solution has been found to size and organize the Image Component preventing it from occupying the full width of
the page when the case's screen template is changed.
A new Lighting Record Page template has been created, which has 3 columns, a header and a footer, allowing to
accommodate an image into a separate column on the page.
Domain Name Creation/Update Improvements
Previously, creating Domain Name records required both a related Domain Name Extension and a Domain Name
Family. Now, it is possible to create or update Domain Name records without a Domain Name Family (a Domain
Name Extension is still required).
Page 45
| 1 - What's New
When using the New button for creating a Domain Name, a new pop-up window opens, reflecting the abovementioned change.
New Field 'All Categories' on Mining Session
The All Categories rollup field has been added on the Mining Session record.
Just like the one on Invention Disclosures and Patents, it features a comma-separated list of Category Names from
the from the selected Categorizations.
Advanced Task Management: Fixes for Duplicate and Reassign Task Issues
We have resolved the issues related to the Duplicate Task and Reassign Task functionalities in the Advanced Task
Management module.
Previously, tasks configured to be reassigned would get stuck in an endless loop, and tasks set to be duplicated did
not create new tasks for the selected users.
With this update, tasks can be reassigned to new owners without any issues, and the duplication process correctly
creates tasks for all selected users.
'Remove Image' Button Can Now Be Hidden on IP Portal
We have now introduced a checkbox option Show the Remove Image button on the Image for Display component
that can prevent users from removing the image on the IP Portal.
Page 46
IPfolio User Guide
Once deactivated, the Remove Image button will not be displayed on the Portal.
Cloned Conflict Gets a Sequential Conflict ID
Now when you clone a Conflict, the next sequential Conflict ID is suggested for the newly-created record, and the
sequence count under object settings is increased by one.
User-Contact-Party Properly Linked
It was reported that when creating User records, the matching Contact and Party records would get created, but
without linking the User to the Contact, and the Contact â to the Party.
This has now been resolved, and when a new User record is created, all the User-Contact-Party links are properly
established and auto-filled.

Email and Documents
Email Validation Improvement
We have improved the validation of incorrectly entered Email addresses and added additional security precautions.
Send is only enabled if all Email addresses are correctly formatted. If at least one Email address is incorrectly 
formatted, an error message is displayed, and Send is disabled. This also applies for Reply, Reply All and Forward.
Document Tree Auto-Refresh
We have introduced an automatic refresh function for the Document Tree, ensuring it immediately updates after
file uploads or edits. Additionally, it also refreshes after sending an Email or saving a draft. This enhancement
improves user experience by displaying the most recent changes without manual refresh.
Improved Email Forwarding Process
We have updated the forwarding of Emails when adding new case IDs to the subject line/updating existing case IDs
in the subject line.
Now, when you forward an Email, all content, attachments, and details are preserved, even when new case IDs are
included in the subject line. The forwarded Email is automatically associated with the new case ID.
Page 50
IPfolio User Guide
Display of Email 2 and Email 3 for Law Firm Email Addresses Improved
In the Spring '24 Release Notes (on page 73) we announced that you can now add additional Email recipients
when sending Emails to Law Firms. We have updated the functionality to display the indicators Email 2 and Email 3 
next to the corresponding Law Firm Email Addresses when composing an Email for more clarity.
Individual Email Signature for Reply, Reply All, or Forward
Individual Email signatures are now also available when using Reply, Reply All and Forward. This allows you to
include your name and, if desired, an accompanying image (such as a company logo) at the end of Emails. Further
information on this topic can be found here (on page 192).
Enhanced Reply All Functionality
When you right-click and select Select All, the Email window opens instantly.
The recipient list in the Email window is populated with all intended recipients from the original To/Cc line, including
the original sender. If you are replying to a reply and the sender remains the same as the original, the sender appears
only once in the Email.
Up to 200 Records Can Be Addressed Via Email
This release extends Email integration across multiple records. You can now send Emails to up to 200 various
records - double the previous limit. Better error handling ensures reliable performance.
Email Alerts Only Sent to the Accepted Email Domains Now
We have fixed the issue where automated Email alerts would be sent to the IP Portal users whose Email domains did
not belong to the list of approved ones.
Now automated alerts are only sent to the accepted Email domains (Admin Panel > Portal Settings > Inventor
Portal: Accepted email domains) .
Inbound Emails - 'New' Keyword Trigger Disabled
Previously, there was an automatic record creation trigger for Emails with the keyword New in the subject line. This 
led to unnecessary generation of new records.
With this update, incoming Emails are now associated with pre-existing records based on the record ID mentioned
in the subject line. If the specified record ID does not exist, the sender will receive a rejection Email.
Page 51
| 1 - What's New
Resolved: Issue with Email Reply Addresses Not Populating
We have resolved the issue where Email addresses in the To field were not being populated when using Reply/Reply 
All for outbound Emails in the Document Tree. Now, the Email addresses in the To field are automatically populated 
with the Email addresses from the original outbound Email.
Resolved: Template Insertion Issue
Email templates were failing upon insertion, generating error messages when invoked. The issue was identified
and resolved. The error was traced to the handling of text-only templates. Email templates now populate correctly
without errors.
Filing Strategy
For this release, we have made significant improvements to our Filing Strategy (on page 243) module, improving
the process of managing Patent filings across different jurisdictions.
General Information/Updates
âª Previously the Decision Date was filled out automatically. You can now manually adapt the Decision Date.
âª Countries are now listed alphabetically during Child Record creation.
Manage Filing Countries
âª The interface for managing Filing Countries has been improved. It is now more intuitive and user-friendly.
âª Easily adjust country selections as requirements change.
âª Further information can be found here (on page 243).
Filing Strategy Phase Country Group Implementation
We have added a new lookup related to the Country Group for Filing Strategy Phases.
Page 52
IPfolio User Guide
âª You can now select only countries that belong to the specified Country Group when applying a Filing Strategy
for a particular Phase.
Figure 1. Example: Only countriesfrom African Regional IPO show for the Test Phase
âª The layout in the Filing Strategy Phase includes the new Country Group lookup.
âª If a Phase does not have a Country Group assigned, there are no restrictions - you can choose from all active
countries (excluding inactive ones).
Improved Country Search
The search for Filing Strategy Countries was significantly improved. Based on your input, the system will suggest
relevant countries. Additionally, only countries that align with the specified Phase will be displayed.
Page 53
| 1 - What's New
Clone Filing Strategies
âª The new Clone feature lets you easily duplicate an existing Filing Strategy.
âª After cloning of the Filing Strategy ,you can easily adapt the Filing Strategy to suit your needs.
âª Further information can be found here (on page 250).
Change/Add Filing Strategies
âª You can now change the Filing Strategy even after initial selection. Previously this was not possible, as once
a strategy was chosen, it was locked down. This is especially useful when circumstances evolve or new
information becomes available.
âª Apply different strategies to the same invention at various stages.
âª You can define multiple strategies covering multiple Phases.
âª Further information can be found here (on page 253).
Patents
New Integration: Tangibly
Integration with Tangibly â a tool that detects trade secrets in patents using AI â is now available in IPfolio!
A new button Discover Trade Secrets has been created and can be added to the Patent page layout.
Once clicked, it will take you to the Tangibly platform (pre-condition: the Patent must have a patent number).
For details on this and other IPfolio integrations please see Integrations (on page 469).
Page 54
IPfolio User Guide
Enhancement of Renewal Management Features
With this update, the Renewal Table Field Set now includes the Lapse Date and Lapse Reason fields from the 
existing Patent object. This means, that you can now conveniently access and edit these critical fields directly within
the Family Wide Renewals table.
Updated Workflow for SPC Records
The workflow for the Patent child records whose Relationship to Parent is Supplementary Protection Certificate 
has been updated as follows:
âª Two new fields have been created on Patent records: SPC Start Date and SPC End Date (the first and last days
of the Supplementary Protection Certificate validity, respectively).
âª A new Status (High-Level and Prosecution) update logic has been introduced for SPC records, which is in
place if the Relationship to Parent on the Patent record is Supplementary Protection Certificate, and a new 
configuration custom field called Enable SPC Status Logic Calculation (Setup> Custom Code> Custom 
Metadata Types > Configuration > Enable SPC Status Logic Calculation) is set to true. For details please see
Status (High-Level) (on page 788) and Status (Prosecution) (on page 790).
âª The fields to be copied from parent to child Patents on child record creation, when Relationship to Parent on 
the child record is Supplementary Protection Certificate, have been defined in a newly created field set (Copy 
when creating SPC child records) as follows:
âª Filing Date;
âª Earliest Priority Date;
âª Earliest Priority Number.
If necessary, this default field set can be extended to include other fields.
Assignees Properly Copied From Patent Family to Patent
Previously, when creating a Patent record from a Patent Family, the Ownership Type field values would not get 
copied and remain blank under the Assignment History tab of the newly created Patent.
Page 55
| 1 - What's New
To resolve this, a new picklist field Ownership Type has been created on the Assignee (Patent Family) record, and
now the functionality works as follows:
When creating a Patent from a Patent Family, IPfolio copies current assignees from the Patent Family to the Patent
(the Party, Display Order, Ownership Type and Ownership Share [%] field values are copied.)
The data propagation takes place only upon Patent creation. If later on an assignee is added to/removed from the
Patent Family, this will not be copied over to the related child Patents, and will be applicable only to the Patents that
are created from the Patent Family after the change.
Trademarks
Optimized Creation of Subsequent Filings from a WO Trademark Record
With this release, we have introduced numerous improvements in the process of Creating Foreign Filings (on page
315).
In particular, we have extended and enhanced the options of creating subsequent filings from an existing WO
Trademark record.
Now when using Create TM Filing Instruction on a WO Trademark record, in the Options section you can choose to
âª Add subsequent designations to the existing WO Trademark (Is Subsequent Designation â selected by default if
Registration Date is filled.)
âª Add countries to the existing WO Trademark without claiming subsequent designation (Is Designation â 
selected by default if Registration Date is empty.)
âª Create a new WO Trademark (Create New WO Trademark).
Additional Trademark Procedures Added / Create TM Filing Instruction Logic Updated for
National Filing Countries
We have also expanded the list of the Procedures supported when using Create TM Filing Instruction to include 
such options as, e.g., Associated, Divisional, Slogan (for the full list of the currently available picklist options please
see Procedure (on page 871)).
Also, the Create TM Filing Instruction logic has been adapted as follows:
Page 56
IPfolio User Guide
âª For National Filing Countries Procedure defaults to National.
âª When leaving the Procedure at National, Trademarks created for every National Filing Country selected get
Procedure = National.
âª If a different value is selected for Procedure, all Trademarks created for every National Filing Country selected
get that respective Procedure value.
Updated Logic for Copying Down Classes & Goods When Using 'Create TM Filing Instruction'
We have updated the logic for copying down Classes & Goods when creating TM Filing Instructions from a 
Trademark as follows:
âª Classes & Goods are pre-populated with the Classes & Goods of the Base Trademark.
âª If Claim Priority is selected in the Options section of the Create TM Filing Instruction form and Earliest 
Priority Filing ID has a value, Classes & Goods are pre-populated with the Classes & Goods of the Priority 
Trademark.
âª If Claim Priority is selected and Earliest Priority Filing ID is blank, Classes & Goods are copied down from the 
Base Trademark.
CompuMark/IP One Data Sync Refined for International Designations
To avoid linking International Designations to local jurisdiction details (as international application/registration
numbers might match local jurisdictions), now when a sync is performed on a child Trademark, whose parent's
Country Code is WO, the following logic is in place:
âª If there is a value in the CompuMark ID field on the parent WO Trademark, it is used to perform a sync on the
child record.
âª If CompuMark ID on the parent WO record is blank, WO is used instead of the childâs Country Code.
New Field 'Maintenance Status' on Trademark Family
A new picklist field Maintenance Status has been introduced on Trademark Family with the following values:
âª Maintain All
âª Drop All
âª Decide Individually
âª Undecided
Page 57
| 1 - What's New
Documents Preview and Download after Manual IPsync on Trademarks Functions Properly Now
We have resolved the issue where after a manual IPsync on a Trademark, documents would be displayed in the
Document Tree, but with no possibility to preview or download them.
Now, after triggering IPsync on a record, the retrieved documents can be successfully previewed, opened and
downloaded.
Designated Country Records Updated When a WO Parent Gets a Cancelled/Abandoned Date
and Lapses
Previously, designated country records wouldn't get updated when their WO parent Trademark had a Cancelled/
Abandoned Date entered and changed its status to Lapsed.
We have fixed it, and now Cancelled/Abandoned Date is copied down from WO Trademarks to child records. If a
WO Trademark lapses, its child records change their status to Lapsed as well.
Please note that if a National Filing Country record has a WO parent assigned to it, the above-described logic will
be applied to it, too: in particular, if the status of the parent WO Trademark changes to Lapsed, the National Filing 
Country record's status will change to Lapsed as well.
E-Correspondence
New Fields on Patent and Trademark Records
Within the ongoing E-Correspondence (JP) integration, the following fields were created:
Page 58
IPfolio User Guide
âª PTO All Representatives and PTO All Assignees on Trademark (auto-populated with external PTO data â the
'representatives' and 'applicants' values from the E-Correspondence Service, respectively).
âª PTO All Representatives on Patent (auto-populated with external PTO data â namely, the 'representatives'
value from the E-Correspondence Service).
Prior Art from E-Correspondence
The latest update introduces enhancements to the Data Audits feature, specifically for processing Prior Art from 
the E-Correspondence service. When a new Prior Art Data Audit is detected, the system will now verify the
existence of the Prior Art and appropriately update the records. This includes adding new Cited Reference records
for the Patent if Prior Art already exists or creating new Cited Reference records and Prior Art records in the
opposite case.
Page 59
| 1 - What's New
Data Audits
Extended Data Audit Acceptance
Previously, you could only update a Data Audit by using the buttons Accept/Discard. You can now also accept Data
Audits by updating the Status field. This new process allows you to mass-update the status for thousands of Data
Audits by simply updating the Status field.
When a Data Auditâs status changes from New to Accepted, all necessary acceptance logic is automatically 
triggered. This includes copying values into the record, creating Classes & Goods for Trademarks, and generating
Parties.
New Field 'Audit Decision Comment' on Data Audit
Previously, when the user discarded a Data Audit, the instructions/comments sent to the service provider were not
stored on the Data Audit record, and couldn't be reviewed/cross-referenced later on.
Now a new field Audit Decision Comment has been added on the Data Audit record, so when the user discards 
a Data Audit, the text introduced in Reason for Rejecting or Ignoring is stored and populated to the new field as 
follows:
"Decision: Ignore. Reason: Text entered in the Audit Decision Comment field."
"Decision: Reject. Reason: Text entered in the Audit Decision Comment field."
For more information on Data Audits please see Data Audits (on page 364).
Tasks
Advanced Task Management- Data Propagation for Follow-Up Tasks
We have implemented an automatic data copying feature for tasks and their Follow-Up tasks upon creation, so that
you can customize which fields are copied.
To achieve this, we introduced a new field set called the Data Propagation Fieldset on the Task object. Any fields
included in this set will automatically propagate their values from the parent Task to Follow-Up Tasks when a
Follow-Up Task is created.
Task Owner Update Automation Update
When a recordâs owner on certain objects is changed, all open tasks assigned to the previous record owner now
automatically update to match the new owner. This enhancement ensures that manual changes to individual task
owners remain unaffected when updating the record owner. Previously available for the objects Patent, Trademark,
and Invention Disclosure, this feature has now also been added to the objects:
âª Conflict,
âª Contract, and
âª Trademark Search Request.
Page 60
IPfolio User Guide
Other Improvements
Image For Display on Third Party Patent and Third Party Patent Family
You can now add the Image For Display component to Third Party Patent and Third Party Patent Family objects.
This enhancement allows you to easily display associated images for records in these objects. Further information
on this feature can be found here (on page 202).
Single Select Synchronous Category Tree Now Properly Rendered
Previously, the Synchronous Category Tree was rendering checkbox buttons (i.e. Multi Select option) in both of the
following cases:
âª If the Tree Type field on the Category Type record was set to Single Select.
âª If the Tree Type field on the Category Type record was blank or set to Multi Select.
This has now been fixed and functions as follows:
âª If Tree Type is set to Single Select, the Synchronous Category Tree renders radio buttons.
âª If Tree Type is blank or set to Multi Select, the Synchronous Category Tree renders checkbox buttons.
New Field 'Date Search Requested' on Invention Disclosure
A new field Date Search Requested, showing the date when a patentability search was requested from the Search 
Provider, has been introduced on the Invention Disclosure record. It is populated by the IDF - Request Search flow.
Page 61
| 1 - What's New
Record Images of All Sizes Displayed without Distortion Now
We have resolved the issue with the distortion of small-sized images set as a Trademark record image, and now:
âª Small images keep their original size if they are smaller than the image section.
âª Bigger images are resized to fit the image section.
Lapse Reason Field Update for Renewals
We have enhanced the renewal process across our entire family of Patents and Trademarks.
When the Pay field is set to No, the Lapse Reason field now updates automatically. For Patents, itâs set to NonPayment of Fees, and for Trademarks, it is marked as Abandoned.
If you revert the Pay field back to Yes, the Lapse Reason and Drop Date fields reset to null, restoring the original 
status.
The Maintenance Status and Drop Date fields now align with the Lapse Reason, ensuring consistency. If the
Maintenance Status is manually set to Inactive the Lapse Reason will also be updated to Non-Payment of Fees.
General Salesforce Enhancements
Get Better Performance for List Views
You can now expect better performance from your list views due to several changes behind the scenes.
List views for custom objects will now render with Lightning Web Components (LWC) instead of Aura, which is
much faster.
Add New Custom Fields to Dynamic Forms-Enabled Pages
Add new custom fields to Dynamic Forms quickly and easily!
Page 62
IPfolio User Guide
This much-requested enhancement is sure to help speed up the deployment of new fields to Dynamic Forms.
New Screen Component: Action Buttons (Beta)
A new screen component called Action Button is a real game changer.
Now you can run auto-launched flows directly from flow screens and receive an output.
Action buttons are going to make using screen flows much easier.

new UI elements and the continuous improvement of existing UI terminology.
CRM Analytics
New IDF Dashboard Added for CRM Analytics
A new CRM Analytics dashboard has been introduced that combines history data from the Invention Disclosure
History table with the Invention Disclosure table. Such a report is not possible with standard Salesforce reporting.
Page 67
| 1 - What's New
The new IDF Status History dashboard shows the time an Invention Disclosure stays in a certain stage, e.g. how
many days it takes to go from Sent to Committee to Committee Recommendation Received.
Note: This feature requires setup. If interested, please contact the IPfolio Premium Services Team.
Annuities/Renewals
Renewal Filing Receipt
A new method was implemented to fetch the Payment receipt documents automatically. To achieve this, a
scheduled job was created. When this scheduled job gets executed, it invokes the method mentioned previously to
fetch the documents. After the scheduled job has been executed, the Payment receipt documents are successfully 
retrieved from the subscription service.
Service Status Now Correctly Updated When Syncing IPAN, IPxChange
The Service Status (on page 815) field reflects the status of renewal payments. It is now correctly updated on all
Renewal/Maintenance objects with the value from the subscription service when syncing.
Patents
Lapse Date No Longer Auto-Populated for US Provisionals
The Lapse Date (on page 738) field is no longer auto-populated for US provisionals, which helps to avoid the risks
of miscalculation, incorrect manual Maximum Term update, etc.
Page 68
IPfolio User Guide
EP Validation Process Enhanced
A new Quick Action button EP Validation is now available on Patent records. If you are using the EP Validation
service, it can be configured to take you directly to the EPV Portal. If a Filing Strategy was selected beforehand, the
jurisdictions will be preselected there.
For details please see Executing a Filing Strategy: Relation Logic (on page 257).
IDS Matrix Can Be Exported Now
You can now export IDS Matrix to a .csv file using a new Quick Action button Export IDS Matrix introduced on 
Patents.
For details please see Exporting the IDS Matrix (on page 282).
Unitary Patent: Opt-Out Status
A new formula field Opt-Out Status (on page 738), helpful for reporting purposes associated with the Unitary 
Patent, has been introduced on Patents.
It indicates if a Patent was opted-out from the jurisdiction of the Unitary Patent Court (UPC), and is only applicable
for UP, EP and EP validation records.
Checkbox 'Provisional' Can Now Be Added on the Create Child Record(s)
Lightning Component
The option of adding the 'Provisional' checkbox has been introduced on the 'Create Child Record(s)' Lightning
component.
It enables you to create 2nd/3rd provisional records from a Provisional Patent record (PR1) by using the Create 
Child Records Quick Action button (while previously, a regular Patent and docket action for a non-provisional
Patent were created, even though the Name of the new Patent contained 'PR2').
Page 69
| 1 - What's New
Enhanced Data Propagation on WO Records
For International Design Designations (Type of Right = 'Design', Relationship to Parent = 'International Design'),
the Filing Date and Application Number values of the WO parent are now inherited and copied over into the samename fields of the children records.
For details please see Data Propagation: WO Children (on page 230).
Trademarks
Trademark/Trademark Family Categorizations Interdependency Logic Functions
Properly Now
The Trademark/Trademark Family Categorizations interdependency logic now works the same way it has already
been functioning for Patent/Patent Family Categorizations:
Categorizations made on the Family level are not applied to the Trademarks belonging to the Family and can be
removed from the Family record only manually.
If a specific Categorization is made on the Trademark level, it rolls up to the Trademark Family. If it is later removed
from all the Trademarks belonging to a Family, it will be automatically removed from the superordinate Family
record.
For details please see Category Tree (on page 165).
Watch Order Email Address Added for Japan
Previously, depending on a customerâs location, watch order forms were handled either by the AM or EMEA Teams.
Now, a new communication logic has been implemented specifically for Japan. Whenever Japanese clients place a
watch order, the Email address of the CompuMark Japan Team is used for the communication.
Law Firm Set as Required Now
When using the Create Trademark Quick Action from Trademark Search Request, Law Firm is marked as a
mandatory field now.
TM Filing Instruction (TMFI) Improvements
The TMFI tool has been enhanced as follows:
Page 70
IPfolio User Guide
âª A new field Edition Number has been created on Class Definition records. Now if you are using several different
versions of a Class Code (e.g., based on different business units), when using the TMFI tool, this field is populated
and you can select Class Code + Edition Number from the dropdown list. This feature is also available in the
Classes & Goods section on Trademark and Trademark Search Request records.
âª The Class Type field is now placed between Created From and Class Code and defaulted to 'Nice (Trademarks,
International)'. The Class Code values are filtered by Class Type.
For more details please see TMFI: Classes & Goods (on page 314).
IPsync
Page 71
| 1 - What's New
Case Types with the Same Application Number Now Differentiated for Japan
Since in Japan application numbers can be duplicative across Patents, Utility Models and Designs, IPsync was
previously enabled only for the Japanese customers managing Patents.
Now case types can be differentiated during the IPsync data retrieval, so Design and Utility Model data are scraped
as well.
The data retrieval functions both for full sync on the Admin Panel and for single sync performed through the record
detail page.
For information on the supported application number formats please see Application Number Formats (on page
323).
Earliest Priority Filing ID on Patents and Trademarks Populated through IPsync
Now
The Earliest Priority Filing ID field on Patents (on page 738) and Trademarks (on page 853) is now populated from 
IPsync with the Patent/Trademark ID whose Filing (Application) details correspond to the earliest PRIORITY or
PARENT details retrieved - whichever is earlier.
When a record has no PRIORITY or PARENT information or when the lookup points to the record itself (e.g., when
the PRIORITY details of the record equal the Filing details), this field remains empty.
Pre-condition: Admin Panel > Data Feed > IPSync > Populate multiple Parents from PAIR must be set to true.
Email and Documents
Automatic Assignment of Email Ownership
The ownership of an Email is now automatically assigned based on the following scenarios:
âª Outgoing Emails: The sender of the Email is assigned as the Email owner.
âª Inbound Response Emails: For responses to Emails initially sent out by IPfolio, the assigned Email owner is the
sender of the initial Email.
âª Unassociated Inbound Emails: If a received Email is not a direct response to an Email initially sent out by IPfolio
(i.e. an unrelated Email), the owner of the relevant case is assigned as the Email owner.
The ownership is visible in the Document Tree, the File Details of the Document Tree and the Document Tab.
Please also see Email Settings: Automatic Assignment of Email Ownership (on page 197).
Email Signature for Individual Users Available
If the previously available Customer Signature (on page 559) feature only allowed company-wide signatures
without a possibility of adding logos/images, now you can create your own signatures with an individual name and a
logo.
For step-by-step instructions please see Include Individual Email Signature (on page 192).
Once set up, the signature will automatically show at the end of the Email upon its creation.
Page 72
IPfolio User Guide
Cc, Bcc and Template Can Now Be Hidden During Email Creation
A new collapse button has been implemented on the Email creation panel.
When creating an Email in the Documents tab you can now hide the Cc, Bcc and Template fields in the header 
section of the Email, thus getting more space in the Email body.
The function is also available for the expanded Email view.
Additional Email Recipients for Emails to Law Firms
You can now add additional Email recipients when sending Emails to Law Firms. If the Email2 and Email3 fields are 
used/populated on the corresponding Law Firm record, these Email Addresses will show up in the draft of a new
Email.
For more details please see Include Additional Email Recipient Suggestions for Law Firms (on page 198).
Visible on Portal Menu Option Now Available for Emails in the Documents Tab
The menu option 'Visible on Portal' is now available for inbound/outbound Emails. If you right-click on an E-Mail in
the Documents tab and select 'Visible on Portal', the Email will show up on the Portal.
Integration of Clone Functionality within Document Tree on Patents and
Trademarks
You can now clone documents directly from the Document Tree on Patent and Trademark records. After rightclicking on the document that needs to be cloned and selecting Clone, a new window pops up. You can search for
Patent/Trademark ID to specify where the document(s) should be copied. After clicking Clone, a confirmation 
message appears, and the selected documents are being copied to the corresponding Patents/Trademarks.
For more information please see Cloning Documents (on page 175).
Page 73
| 1 - What's New
File and Document Titles Kept in Sync
Now if you edit a file title in the Document Tree of a record, the Subject and Title fields on the corresponding 
Document record are updated with the new name as well, thus being kept in sync with the Title field of the modified 
File record.
For more details please see Editing File and Document Titles (on page 175).
As a result, the updated file name shows up in these instances:
âª The Subject column in the UI of the Document Tree
âª The File Title (right-click on the renamed file and select 'File Details')
âª The Document Title in the Documents Tab
E-Submission
E-Submission Widget
You can now easily create submission packages for the JPO and INPIT with the help of the dedicated E-Submission
Widget.
After you choose the Submission Type (e.g., 'Request for Examination' or 'Annuity Payment (Design)') and enter the
necessary data/attach documents, this correspondence is sent to the shared E-Submission Service that processes it 
and generates an HTML file, which complies with JPO requirements and data requirements for electronic transfer
via INPIT, and can be used for submission.
For more information please see E-Submission (on page 428).
Advanced Task Management
Introduction of Ultimate Parent Task
Previously, whenever a Follow-up Task with Advanced Task Management was to be created, all Parent and Child
Tasks had to be complete, i.e. open Parent or Child Tasks were not allowed. This logic was changed to allow the
creation of Follow-up Tasks if there are open Parent tasks and only prevent the creation of Follow-up Tasks if open
Child Tasks exist.
In the Task Option Definitions you can now select the Option 'Close Ultimate Parent Task'. After choosing this
option during the Advanced Task Management Flow, the Ultimate Parent Task Status changes to 'Completed' with
the Completion Date being the current date. After the Ultimate Parent Task is closed the Flow continues with the
Continue action.

IPfolio User Guide
For further information please see Advanced Task Management (on page 432).
IP Portal
User-Contact Relation Functionality Enhanced for the Lightning Portal
A new field - Portal ContactId - has been added on the User (on page 915) records.
The logic for retrieving a Contact by a given User is now as follows:
âª If the Custom Setting 'Use EmployeeID for matching' (on page 559) is enabled, a Contact with a Unique 
Employee Id matching the Userâs Employee Number is searched for.
âª If the Custom Setting 'Use EmployeeID for matching' is disabled, a Contact with an Id matching the Userâs Portal
Contact Id is searched for.
âª If none can be found that way, a Contact with an Email matching the Userâs Email is searched for.
Records
Large Images Set as Record Image Automatically Resized Now
Previously, when an image was added to a record and selected as the Record Image, it was not automatically resized
and could cover the whole record page.
This has now been fixed and large images are automatically resized and adjusted to the displayed page.
For more information on Record Image please see Core Features: Record Image (on page 201).
Other Improvements
Short Fields Introduced/Adapted on Several Objects
Since long text areas cannot be used in formulas, the following new fields were introduced:
âª All Products (Short) (on page 799) on Patent Family
âª All Categories (Short) (on page 705) on Invention Disclosure
They are respectively populated with the assigned Products/Categories and are subject to a character limit of up to
255 characters. If this limit is exceeded, additional Products/Categories are not added to these fields.
The same logic applies to the existing All Categories (Short) (on page 738) field on Patents now. Previously, each
Category was added in a new line, and once the 255-character limit was exceeded, only the extra characters were
trimmed, the last listed Category name being cut off in the middle. With the new behavior, the Categories are
separated by a semicolon, and if the last listed Category name(s) donât fit in the total of 255 characters, they are not
displayed at all.

New Filing Strategy Module
With our new Filing Strategy module you can define and set up a strategy for your IP applications in various
jurisdictions and in different filing phases. Within a filing strategy, the initial approach and the priorities concerning
filing are outlined. It provides a roadmap for managing IP assets.
A well-developed filing strategy protects and leverages your intellectual property effectively and you have a
convenient management tool in hand.
Selecting a Filing Strategy
Once the Filing Strategy objects are defined as needed, the Filing Strategy can be selected and applied within an
Invention Disclosure.
Applying the Filing Strategy
When applying the Filing Strategy, the configured filing countries for each phase are pre-selected and can be
adapted if needed.
Page 76
IPfolio User Guide
For further information on the new module, see Patent Lifecycle > Filing Strategy (on page 243).
Advanced Task Management
IPfolioâs Advanced Task Management module makes it possible to configure workflows for specific tasks and also to
have all means for task completion in one place. Tasks and follow up tasks are generated in the background. All the
essential configurable properties of tasks are located in one place. This in turn means, that existing workflows can
be easily adapted to suit business process changes or other modifications.
For further information on the new module, see Docketing > Advanced Task Management (on page 432).

Email and Documents
Improved Email Templates Functionality
âª It is now possible to create an email template that includes an attachment. When the user creates 
an email template with an attachment and later navigates to the specific objectâs Documents
section, clicks on the Create Email button to use that previously created template, the original
Page 78
IPfolio User Guide
attachment is included in the email. There is also an option to remove the attachment, if needed.
âª Previously, when an email was sent from a template in the Documents section of a Patent, and the ipfolio.cc
email was used, it would automatically show up twice - both as sent and as received, sometimes causing
confusion and redundancy. This has now been fixed, and when an email is sent from a template, it is only created
and displayed as an outgoing one.
âª When the user clicks on the Create Email button, expands the email window, clicks anywhere in the email body
and inserts an email template, the cursor doesnât jump to the bottom of the page and is properly positioned at
the top of the email body. The same behavior is ensured for the regular (non-template) email functionality when
using Reply, Reply All, or Forward actions.
Attachments No Longer Added to the Message When Using Reply/Reply All
When an email is sent from the Documents tab using the Reply or Reply All actions, the attachments are no longer 
included in the message (unlike the way it functioned in the past, when attachments were automatically added).
Thus, duplication is avoided and a consistent user experience with other email systems is ensured. When an email is
being forwarded, attachments keep being included in the email.
Email to Inventors Functions Properly Now
The Emailto Inventors functionality has now been fine-tuned (the email is sent to inventors, the sender being
correctly set), and functions properly under the following conditions:
âª A valid email template is plugged in into the Emailto Inventors field on an Invention Disclosure (on page 705) / 
Patent (on page 738);
âª The inventorâs email domain is part of the Inventor Portal: Accepted email domains
custom setting (Admin Panel > Portal Settings > Inventor Portal: Accepted email domains).
Page 79
| 1 - What's New
âª If Use Org Wide Email in SendEmail (Admin Panel > Email Settings > Use Org Wide
Email in SendEmail) is enabled and Org Email Address contains a valid OrganizationWide Email Address, the email is sent from the Organization-Wide Email Address. 
âª If Use Org Wide Email in SendEmail is disabled, the email is sent from sender@ipfolio.com.
Reminder Emails Can Now Be Sent from the TM Renewal Phase Object
For details please see the Trademarks (on page 84) section of this page;
Document Preview Enhancements
The document preview has been improved and made more user-friendly. Now when the cursor is hovered over the
file name associated with a specific document record in the Documents tab, the file content preview is automatically
displayed in the preview pane, whose size has been increased by 50% compared to what it used to look like before.
The new preview pane functions properly across all supported browsers, mobile devices, monitors, laptops, etc.
Category Tree
With the IPfolio Winter '24 release, a bigger initiative to improve and enhance the Category Tree functionality has
been started, the first implemented improvements being the following:
Page 80
IPfolio User Guide
Improved Synchronization between Patent and Patent Family Categorizations
The Categorizations displayed on the Category Tree of a Patent Family now always represent the sum of all current
Categorizations of the Patents within this family.
Category Tree Now Also Available for Third Party Patents
In addition to other IPfolio objects that already supported the Category Tree function, it is now also possible to
categorize Third Party Patents and Third Party Patent Families.
For further information on Category Trees, see Category Tree (on page 80).
IPsync
IPsync Added for Brazil
IPsync functionality is now available for Brazil, with all the related buttons/fields being properly rendered, when BR
is indicated as Country.
For the Application Number formats for BR patents, accepted by the system, please see the Field Library (on page
738).

Optimized Unitary Patents Management
âª Two new fields, enabling the user to access the Unified Patent Courtâs (UPC) Case Management System (CMS)
records directly from an EP case, have been created on the Patent object:
âª Link to UPC Case Search - The EP Publication Number is used to search the CMS, 
providing quick and convenient access to all existing UPC cases for the Patent.
Page 82
IPfolio User Guide
âª Link to UPC Opt-out Search - The EP Publication Number is used to search the CMS, 
providing quick and convenient access to the existing Opt-out cases for the Patent.
Page 83
| 1 - What's New
âª In order to support Unitary Patent-related tasks, the picklist for the Translation Language
field on the Patent object has been extended and now includes all the 24 EU languages
(as opposed to only three values - English, French, and German - it offered before).
Trademarks
Harmonized Goods/Services Description
Goods/Services Description has been brought into consistency for the Classes & Goods section on the Trademark
Details page and the one in the window opening once the Create TM Filing Instruction button is clicked.
Previously, the Trademark Details page would show Class Description (short) (on page 610), and the TM Filing 
Instruction window - Class Description (long) (on page 610). Also, the Class Code in All Goods and Services on the 
Trademark Details page was displayed twice (both short and long versions).
The Goods/Services Description and All Goods and Services values have now been harmonized for all the above
instances and are everywhere based on the Class Description (long) field of the Class Definition object.
Page 84
IPfolio User Guide
Record Image Now Propagates to Trademark Child Records Created With TM
Filing Instruction
Record Image is now successfully copied from the base Trademark to child records created with the TM Filing 
Instruction button, when the Preview Image or Image Attachment Id fields are included in the 'Copy when creating
child records' field set.
Sending Reminder Emails from the TM Renewal Phase Object Now Possible
Trademark admin can now set a reminder based on the due date on the TM Renewal Phase object and have a
reminder email sent to the responsible user (Responsible for Phase).
For this, three new fields have been added on TM Renewal Phase:
âª Reminder Email Subject,
âª Reminder Email Body,
âª Reminder Date.
Page 85
| 1 - What's New
The email is sent out on the Reminder Date, which is automatically set to the date that represents the halftime of 
the current phase (between the Phase Start Date and Phase End Date).
With every update of Phase Start Date, Phase End Date is recalculated (Phase Start Date+Phase Duration). 
However, please keep in mind that Reminder Date is automatically calculated only upon the record creation, and 
with every Phase Start Date change, it has to be manually amended.
It is now also possible for the user to bind the due date into the email subject and email body. For this, [Due Date]
(without spaces) should be typed in any spot of the email subject/ body, and the value of the Due Date Start field will 
be shown on the email once it is sent.
If Due Date Start changes later on, [Due Date] in the email will be automatically updated upon sending.
CRM Analytics
Country Group Functionality Introduced
A new Data Model, enabling the correct display of the IP portfolio coverage on the World Map via CRM Analytics,
has been introduced.
Previously, the membership to international intellectual property treaties (e.g., the Patent Cooperation Treaty
(PCT) (1970), the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks (1891), the Madrid
Protocol (1989)) used to be reflected in IPfolio using a Boolean field in the Country object against the country 
record. However, this model had a number of limitations that made it difficult to properly render the IP portfolio
coverage on the World Map (e.g., all EU member states should be shown when 1 EUIPO trademark record exists in
the system).
This has now been addressed by adding the following objects and fields to the CRM Analytics functionality:
Object Field
Country
Designation 
Required
Group Code
Group Type
Country Group (Used to create a group record that will set on top of the Country Group Members 
as a unifying connector to state what Countries are a part of this group.)
Type of IP
Page 86
IPfolio User Guide
Which Base 
Date
Date 
Ceased

Country
Country Group Member (Junction object between the Country Object and the Country Group object, which allows multiple countries to be a part of multiple groups.)
Country 
Group
These changes will also enable future improvements throughout the system where treaty (or group) country data is
required.
IPfolio Summer '23
Advanced Dashboard Analytics
IPfolio now offers completely new Dashboard views - enabling users to visualize and analyze large data sets 
(enriched with third-party data such as IPwe financial valuations) faster and more flexibly than ever before.
Leveraging Advanced Analytics from CRM Analytics, the following functionality can now be enabled on any IPfolio
page - including the Home page or any other App or Portal page:
âª Portfolio Explorer - visualize categories, drill down for more information, see a list of related information.
âª World Map - sort by trademark name and explore the world map to see the jurisdictions in which a trademark is
present.

For more information, see Advanced CRM Analytics Dashboards (on page 498).
Note: This feature requires setup by the IPfolio Premium Services Team. If interested, please complete the
following online form: IPfolio Summer '23 Release.
E-Correspondence
The new E-Correspondence functionality extracts documents and bibliographic data from Japan Patent Office
(JPO) correspondence packages.
For more information, please see Uploading PTO Correspondence (on page 422).
Note: This feature requires setup by the IPfolio Premium Services Team as well as an active subscription to
IPsync. If interested, please complete the following online form: IPfolio Summer '23 Release.
Annuities/Renewals

IPfolio User Guide
Data Discrepancy Management
You can now manage data discrepancies retrieved by the renewals data verification team directly in IPfolio â by
processing Data Audits (on page 367), in the same way as with other IPfolio data feed services.
Data Audits can be accepted or discarded (rejected/ignored) - individually or in bulk - and the user decision is 
automatically sent to the service provider. When choosing to reject or ignore a discrepancy, you can also enter the
reason for the decision taken.
The communication between the user and the data verification team has also been enhanced with the help of a
new field introduced on the Data Audit object â Provider Comment â where the service provider can share their
comments on the discrepancy retrieved.
Service Status Now Available on the Renewal/Maintenance Object
Following the customer need for more granularity as to the status of renewal payments, we have now optimized the
existing functionality. The Service Status field on the Renewal/Maintenance object is now automatically populated 
upon synchronization with one of the following values:
âª Scheduled
âª Offered
âª Reminded
âª Instructed
âª Ordered
âª Rejected
âª Canceled
âª Checked
âª Completed
Page 89
| 1 - What's New
âª Discontinued
âª Skipped
Note: This new functionality requires Sync Status field from IPxChange (Custom Settings > Payment
Service > Sync Status field from IPxChange) to be active.
Trademarks
Syncing Trademarks via IP One
We have refined CompuMark syncing and substantially increased the matching probability by applying the IP One
Data matching algorithm for retrieving CompuMark IDs.
To enable this functionality, activate Match Trademarks via IP One on the Admin Panel (Data Feed > CompuMark),
and then run CompuMark Sync on a Trademark, as usual.
Page 90
IPfolio User Guide
Tip: For even better matching results, please mind the Application/Registration Number formatting. A
table defining the CompuMark jurisdictional search criteria (including searchable Application/Registration
Number formats) can be used as a reference: Searching Application and Registration Numbers.
Classes & Goods Enhancements
The New Class and Goods screen on the Trademark object has been refined (Trademark > Classes & Goods > New):
Classes are now displayed as follows: Class Code - Class Type - Class Description(short).
When new Classes & Goods are added, and the Class type is 'Local', it is displayed between Class Code and Class
Description.
Category Trees Now Available for Domain Names and Third Party Trademarks
The Category Tree functionality has been extended to the following object types:
âª Domain Names
âª Third Party Trademarks
Page 91
| 1 - What's New
Categories can be added and will be saved to the Domain Name Categorization and Third Party Trademark
Categorization junction objects.
Exclusion Countries Functionality Enhanced
The Exclusion Countries functionality (on page 95) now works when creating Trademark child records both by
using Create Child Record(s) and Create TM Filing Instruction.
Email and Documents
Improved Usability When Creating Emails
Several improvements have been implemented with regard to the Create Email component (LWC):
âª Documents that are not actually available in Salesforce (e.g. because they have been blacklisted or exceed 12
MB) are now also correctly hidden in the Email component.
âª The size of the Create Email window (including contained input fields) has been increased - allowing for more 
space, especially when entering one or several case numbers.
âª The spelling/capitalization of 'To', 'Cc' and 'Bcc' has been harmonized.
Page 92
IPfolio User Guide
More Fields Populated on Documents for All Record Types
Fields such as Parent Title, In-House Counsel, Record Owner (and some more) are now populated on Documents
for all the objects that can be linked to Documents (Conflicts, Copyrights, IP Contracts, etc.), whereas in the past
these fields were only populated for Patents and Trademarks.
This enhancement is particularly helpful for customers who rely on Documents to understand what has come into 
IPfolio via email and sync services.
Both Internal and External Documents Now Accessible from a Patentâs Documents
Tab
Previously, if a user was trying to open an external document (not saved in IPfolio) that had been uploaded to a
Patent via the Documents tab, an error message would appear, and the document wouldnât open. The reason for
that was that the system expected all the uploaded documents to have been saved on the TDS server, and formed
the URL for all the links accordingly.
This behavior has now been corrected: the system first checks whether the clicked document is internal or external,
and then modifies (or doesnât modify) the URL depending on the data source.
Thus, all documents open in a new browser tab now when double-clicked in the Documents tab.
Conflicts
Classes & Goods Available on Conflicts Now
The Classes & Goods functionality has now also been added to the Conflict object, with special focus on customers 
who would like to track Classes & Goods both for their own and (potentially infringing) third party trademarks using
the Conflicts module.
Page 93
| 1 - What's New
Prior Art
Third Party Patent Management: Prior Art Module Adaptations
To provide support for actions against third party patents, the formerly named Prior Art object will now be used for
more purposes than before. Generally, it will host all data related to specific patent- and non-patent publications
(hence, the new object name - Publication), whereas the data related to the entire IP right will be stored in the 
Patent or Third Party Patent object, respectively.
In view of this, a number of adaptations (including the object and field label changes) have been made.
See the User Guide (on page 268) for details and please mind that the process of harmonizing the labels in the 
system and supporting documentation is still ongoing.
Citing Publications on the IDS Matrix Refined
Previously, for all the patents that had the Application Number and/or Filing Date fields empty, the Cite/Donât
buttons were not displayed on the IDS Matrix.
However, there are cases, where customers need to update references to be cited from the IDS Matrix for US child
patents at the time when the application is filed.
Thus, the functionality has been enhanced, and now the Cite/Donât buttons are displayed on the IDS Matrix for
the US child patents that have one of the following values in the Relationship to Parent field: 'Continuation',
'Continuation-in-Part', or 'Divisional' - even if their Application Number and Filing Date fields are empty.
Page 94
IPfolio User Guide
IPfolio Spring '23
Trademarks
The Spring '23 release brings numerous enhancements to the Trademark Module.
Improved Creation/Editing of Trademark Actions
We have optimized the process of creating/editing TM Actions as follows:
âª Previously, the 'Classes & Goods' and 'Documents' tables were only displayed when an existing TM Action was
edited. Now they are also available on the screen when a new TM Action is created. This means that to edit
those tables, the user doesnât have to close the current screen and go back to the Relations tab - everything is at
hand now.
âª When a TM Action is edited, the 'Fields to Update on Trademark' section loads the data from the corresponding
Trademark, so that the users can see what they are actually changing.
âª The buttons for saving/canceling changes are now located under the 'Fields to Update on Trademark' section.
When creating a TM Action, they are labeled 'Cancel/Create', when editing - 'Back/Save'.
âª The Trademark lookup is disabled when a TM Action is edited (and enabled when it is created).
Page 95
| 1 - What's New
New Field 'Exclusion Countries' on IP Contract
A new field Exclusion Countries (on page 720) is now available on IP Contract. It helps inform users about
limitations when it comes to creating child records in different jurisdictions.
When a Trademark is created in a certain country (e.g., ES) and related to an IP Contract that has some countries
entered in the Exclusion Countries field, (e.g., FR, DE), if a user tries to create child records in one of the countries
mentioned in that field, an error message pops up notifying that itâs not possible to create a record for those 
jurisdictions, as per the IP Contract.
Trademark Status Now Updated Upon Entering Application Date
In the past, the Trademark Status (High-Level) was updated to 'Pending' and Status (Prosecution) - to 'Filed', when
the Application Number was entered. This sometimes resulted in trademark records sitting in incorrect statuses for
a long time, since in some cases it might take more than a year for the Application Number to be issued.
Now Status (High-Level) and Status (Prosecution) update to 'Pending'/'Filed' if Application Date is today or earlier
OR Application Number is entered on a Trademark.
Status (High-Level) and Status (Prosecution) revert back to 'Approved for Filing'/'Not Filed' if the Application
Number AND the Application Date are removed.
For details, see Status (High-Level) (on page 853) and Status (Prosecution) (on page 853).
Proper Classes Displayed on Trademarks and Trademark Search Requests
We have refined searching Classes & Goods on Trademarks and Trademark Search Requests.
Previously, when a search was performed within Classes & Goods, the results shown would not be limited to
Trademark-related classes.
This has now been adjusted and the options listed in the dropdown under Class Definition conveniently include only
Nice classes.
Page 96
IPfolio User Guide
For more information, see Adding Classes and Goods (on page 311).
New Field 'Status Text (Detailed)'
A new field Status Text(Detailed) has been added to Trademarks and is populated with 'Application Status Text'
from TSDR (Trademark Status & Document Retrieval) via IPsync.
Page 97
| 1 - What's New
Invention Disclosures
IDF Can Now Be Submitted Without Generating a PDF
In the past, when an IDF was submitted, a PDF file confirming the submission was automatically generated and
added to the 'Notes and Attachments' section of the Documents component of the Invention Disclosure.
Since this document can have certain formatting issues and doesnât always render all the languages properly (e.g.,
Chinese), the system has now been adjusted to have an option of suppressing the automatic PDF generation and
preventing it from being displayed in the documents list.
This functionality is available on the Lightning Portal only. To have it enabled, leave PDF Generation Page URL on 
the Record Submission component blank.
New Functionality for Citing Prior Art
You can now cite Patent Prior Art directly within Invention Disclosures using the newly added Cite Patent Art
button on the Relations tab.
For details, see Creating a Patent Prior Art Record Within an Invention Disclosure (on page 475).

Direct Filing of Hong Kong (HK) Child Patents Now Possible
Earlier, in order to file a child patent in HK and transmit details to ipan, it was necessary to re-register from an EP,
CN or GB patent by selecting either 'Null' or 'Claims Priority' in the Relationship to Parent field.
Now direct filings have been made possible by adding a new picklist option - 'Confirmation of a Foreign
Registration'- to the Relationship to Parent field.
It appears when creating child patents through the Create Child Records button on an existing Patent.
For all those child patents whose relationship to parent is 'Confirmation of a Foreign Registration' and type of right
is Patent, Design or Utility Model, the data from the following fields are transferred from the parent patent to the
child ones:
âª Filing Date
âª Earliest Priority Date
âª Earliest Priority Number
Also, as an existing functionality, the above-listed fields are also inherited when the Relationship to Parent is 
'Patent of Addition'.
For more details, see Relationship to Parent (on page 738).
Adding Inventors on a Patent Simplified
Adding inventors to an existing Patent is much easier now. Autocomplete has been enabled for the Party and 
New Party from HR List fields on the New Inventor page (Patent > Inventors > New), with convenient dropdowns
suggesting the Inventor Name, Email address and Employee ID (Employee ID is displayed if Use EmployeeID for
matching (on page 559) is enabled). There is also an option to open the All Results window and view all the details 
in a more comprehensive table format.
For more information, see Adding Inventors to an Existing Patent (on page 237).
Page 99
| 1 - What's New
New Field 'Recordation Date' for Adding New Assignees
While previously only Assignment Date was available when a new Assignee was added on a Patent, now a new field
Recordation Date has been added to show the date when the assignment was recorded at the Patent/Trademark
office.
New Fields for Handling Unitary Patents
The following new fields for handling unitary patents are now available:
âª Unitary Patent Request Date
âª Translation Language
âª Unitary Patent Translation Sent
âª Date of Opt-Out
âª Opt-Out Reference
âª Date of Withdrawal Opt-Out
âª Withdrawal Opt-Out Reference
For details, see Patent: Field Library (on page 738).
Other Improvements
Page 100
IPfolio User Guide
New Fields Available on Categorization and TM Categorization
If a customer uses categories for cost centers or business units, there are two new fields on Categorization and TM 
Categorization that can be helpful:
âª Effective Date (Date when the categorization entered into force)
âª Percentage (Can be used e.g., to allocate a patent to a product for inventor remuneration)
Users and Parties Now Mapped via Email or Employee ID
It is now ensured that for every User created in IPfolio a corresponding Party also exists in the system. Previously,
this sync was only available for Users and Contacts.
Whenever a User is created, the system checks if a Party with the same Employee Number OR with the same Email
already exists (depending on whether Use EmployeeID for matching (on page 559) is active or not).
If no existing Party is found, an according record will be created (asynchronously).
Related Record Detail Component Can Now Be Implemented in Flows
The Related Record Detail component can now be used inside and outside of Flows.
It renders differently in each of the two cases, displays buttons conditionally based on whether the navigation is
available, and provides a set of defined fields while allowing a set of given fields to be editable.
Page 101
| 1 - What's New
This functionality can now be used on a record to display and edit related record fields (previously available on Tasks
only to display related record fields).
PortfolioIQ Enhancements
âª PortfolioIQ fields are now defined to be searchable by default.
âª The logic and handling of Lookup fields has been changed: Lookup fields that used to be transferred to
PortfolioIQ as text are now transferred as a list.
For more information, see PortfolioIQ: Additional Field Details (on page 476).
No More Duplication of Links Between Same-Type Objects
IPfolio offers an option to link same-type objects (e.g., two Patents, or two Trademarks), creating links between
them that automatically go both ways.
Previously, if a link from one object to another was created, a backward link was created automatically. After that,
the same two objects could be linked both ways once more, which resulted in duplication.
Now, if two objects are already linked and there is an attempt to link them once again, an error message is displayed,
and no duplicates get created.
If, for some reason, a backward link between the objects already exists and the user creates a forward one, no
additional backward link is created.
Two Separate Document Folders for WIPO and Private PAIR
When organizations are subscribed to both the US Private PAIR and the WIPO data feed, IPfolio now creates two
separate folders in the Documents section of the related record - WIPO and PAIR.
Page 102
IPfolio User Guide
Deprecation (i.e., automated hiding of documents considered outdated) now only happens for US within the PAIR
folder and for WO within the Official Register folder, and only for documents uploaded via IPsync. Documents
uploaded manually by users are never deprecated.
IP One Data and DocketEngine Documentation Extended
Some new resources are available in the IPfolio User Guide:
âª Check IP One Data (on page 298) or Included Data (on page 298) for our newly added IP One Data (IP1D)
Coverage Guide.
âª Check DocketEngine Release Notes (on page 414) for rule updates with DocketEngine Release 19.
General Salesforce Enhancements
We would also like to highlight several new Salesforce features that we find particularly interesting for IPfolio users.
Reports and Dashboards
âª You can now create a custom report type to see which reports, dashboards, or other analytic assets users are
subscribed to.
For more information, see the related Salesforce Spring '23 Release Notes.
Page 103
| 1 - What's New
âª Also, it is now possible to create a dynamic report filter based on the viewing user, so that everyone could
see the records pertinent to them. For example, instead of creating multiple reports that are filtered by
specific Patent Paralegals (Owners), you can use a relative value to filter by 'Patent Paralegal (Owner) equals
$USER' (the current user viewing the report).
For more information, see the related Salesforce Spring '23 Release Notes.
Track Field History for Activities
You can now track up to six fields for Tasks and Events when you turn on field history tracking for Activities.
For more information, see the related Salesforce Spring '23 Release Notes.
IPfolio Winter '23
Improved Exporting of Trademark Images
A new IMAGE function in Microsoft Excel brings considerable improvements regarding the export of images, e.g. as
part of Trademark or Trademark Family reports, from IPfolio to Microsoft Excel.
Based on either public or private image URLs, images can be exported and â thanks to the new IMAGE formula field
in Microsoft Excel â displayed in the correct cells of the Excel report.
This also means that images can now be sorted and filtered with adherent cells, and do automatically resize with the 
corresponding cell.
Page 104
IPfolio User Guide
For details on exporting images, see Image Export to Microsoft Excel (on page 546).
Note: Please note that the IMAGE function required for this new approach is currently only available to
âOffice Insidersâ in Microsoftâs Beta Channel builds. For more information, click here.
Integrated Ordering of IP Services
With this release we are introducing a new option for requesting prior art searches. Now you can order this service
directly from Clarivate.
To do so, use Request Search on the Quick Actions panel of the Invention Disclosure, select Clarivate as a search
provider, attach all documents required to perform the search (i.e. invention disclosure form, detailed description of
the invention, figures if any, etc.) and send the request form to us.
Our team will perform the search based on the documents you provide and report the results via email, which will
be automatically imported into IPfolio.
For details, please see Patentability Search (on page 475).
Enhanced Prior Art / IDS Management
We continue to enhance and expand the Prior Art Management (IDS) Module.
Page 105
| 1 - What's New
Cite Non-Patent Literature within a Patent
Now you can cite Non-Patent Literature (NPL) directly within a Patent. To differentiate between the types of prior
art to be cited, we have added two new buttons on the Relations tab: Cite Patent Art (replacing Add Multiple Prior 
Art) and Cite Non-Patent Art.
For more detailed information, see Creating Prior Art Records Within a Patent (on page 274).
New Jurisdictions for Autoflow of References
Autoflow of references is now available for additional jurisdictions that require duty of disclosure. The updated list
includes the United States, Canada, Israel, India and Thailand.
The Cite/Donât buttons are available on the IDS Matrix for valid applications in these jurisdictions.
Page 106
IPfolio User Guide
Enhanced IP ONE Functionality
We have also been working on the optimization of IP ONE processes, so now:
âª A new feature IP ONE Sync has been added on the Prior Art detail page. It retrieves and overwrites the data
from IP ONE (except for the document set as the Main Prior Art Copy, which remains intact).
Page 107
| 1 - What's New
âª The previously removed Inventor field has been added back to the Prior Art Object and is populated with IP 
ONE Data.
âª Prior Art can be populated with US Design data via IP ONE.
âª You can create Prior Art with or without a Kind Code, the system retrieving IP ONE Data and behaving
differently in each of those two cases. For more information, see Creating a Patent Prior Art Record Within a
Patent (on page 274).
New Fields on the Prior Art Object
Several NPL metadata fields have been added to the Prior Art object:
âª DOI
âª ISBN
âª Volume/Issue
âª Page(s)
âª Publisher
âª Title of Article
âª URL
âª XP Number
As these fields have been added to enable future integrations with other Clarivate products, we recommend
switching to these new standard fields instead of using custom fields for managing the same metadata.
Flexible Handling of Incoming Correspondence
IPfolio has added advanced functionality for handling incoming correspondence and reviewing the tasks and data to
be created in the system based on this correspondence.
The new module allows you, for example, to:
âª provide your users with central inboxes for different types of incoming correspondence
âª apply custom business rules to incoming documents, e.g. based on their type or source (email, PTO, IPsync, etc.)
âª introduce 4-eye reviews for document types that are considered critical or highly important
âª freely decide upon the degree of automation throughout assigning and processing incoming correspondence
Page 108
IPfolio User Guide
The development of this new module is still being finalized. However, we are very happy to set up according test
environments for early adopters.
For more information on available features and functions, see Incoming Correspondence (on page 414).
Patents
New Fields
We have added two new Patent fields:
âª Examiner Appeal Success Rate - Determines the likelihood of an appeal resulting in an allowance with the
examiner.
âª Examiner Reply Success Rate - Determines the likelihood that an office action reply results in an allowance by
the examiner.
The fields are populated with IP ONE Data, for US patents only.
Examiner Rates Now Synced with IP ONE Data
When using the IP ONE Sync functionality, the following Patent fields are now available and synchronized with IP
ONE Data:
âª Examiner Average Allowance Rate
âª Examiner Pre-Rejection Allowance Rate
âª Examiner Post-Rejection Allowance Rate
âª Forward Citation Assignees
Trademarks
New Opposition Deadline Field
Third Party Trademarks now feature a new date field Opposition Deadline, which is automatically populated when 
creating a new Third Party Trademark using the CompuMark sync.
Page 109
| 1 - What's New
Linking to Third Party Trademarks Enabled
It is now possible to create links between Trademarks and Third Party Trademarks in IPfolio.
Class Type Now Auto-Populated When Entering Class Code
Now, when you add a Trademark Class to the corresponding related list in a Trademark record, the field Class Type
is auto-populated upon entering the Class Code (just like this has already been the case for the field Goods/Services 
Description).
Page 110
IPfolio User Guide
For more details, see Trademarks. Adding Classes and Goods (on page 311).
Separate Default Content Language Available for Trademarks
The new setting 'Default Content Language (Trademarks)' on the Admin Panel (Data Feed > CompuMark) makes
it possible to define a different language as preferred import language for Trademarks than is used for Patents
(imported via IPsync/IP ONE).
Fields to Update Added to TM Actions
A new section 'Fields to Update on Trademark' is now available in TM Actions, enabling the synchronization of the
following Trademark 'Details' with the corresponding record:
Page 111
| 1 - What's New
âª Application Number
âª Application Date
âª Publication Date
âª Notice of Allowance Date
âª Registration Number
âª Registration Date
Invention Disclosures
New Functionality for Citing Prior Art
You can now cite Non-Patent Literature directly within Invention Disclosures using the newly added Cite NonPatent Art feature on the Relations tab.
Email
New Bcc Field
A new Bcc field is now available when creating an email.
Page 112
IPfolio User Guide
No Attachments Created Anymore from Inline Images
Images from email bodies are no longer saved as separate documents creating CPU Timeouts and overloading the
document tree. Only email attachments are saved and displayed in the document tree now.
IP Portal
Custom Fields Now Available for Documents Component
You can now add custom fields to the IP Portal Documents component and edit the values in those fields. This way
you can, for example, display custom drop-down fields and allow your users to assign a specific document type/
attribute to each document.
The logic considers edit access of the respective user. The remaining functionality (uploading and viewing of
documents) works as before.
Page 113
| 1 - What's New
System Administration
File View Component - Configurable Columns
It is now possible to freely define the columns that should be displayed in a File View component. They can be
entered as a comma-separated list in the new field Display Columns. If no fields are configured, the existing default
columns (Title, Document Type, Last Modified Date) will be displayed.
New Dashboard Refresh Config on Admin Panel
We have extended the IPfolio Admin Panel by a General Settings tab, which now provides a Dashboard Refresh
Config view.
This view enables Admin users to:
âª see if an auto-refresh job (for one or more dashboards) is currently scheduled
âª edit/remove the scheduled job (if a job exists)
âª schedule a new job (if no job exists)
The refresh intervals available for selection are 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 7 days and 30 days.
Page 114
IPfolio User Guide
For more information, see Configuring Automatic Dashboard Refreshes (on page 500).
Category Trees Can Now Be Marked 'Read-Only'
You can now mark Category Trees (both synchronous and asynchronous) as 'read-only' in order to replace them
with other/newer Category Trees/Types.
For more information, see Disabling Category Trees (on page 174).
Further Enhancements
IPsync / IP ONE Sync Logs Improved
Previously, when there were multiple services running (or IP ONE discrepancies that would increase the
'Confidence of Match' were accepted), Data Audit Sync Logs were not appropriately invalidated.
This has been changed now. When IP ONE Confidence of Match increases from Medium to High, initiating
automatic updates, the previously reported Data Audit Sync Logs (where the status = Medium) are invalidated with
any new discrepancies reported (with the Confidence of Match = High).
Tasks: Related Record Details Now Available for Additional Objects
You can now configure the 'Related Record Details' component for the following object types:
âª Patent Families
âª Trademark Families
âª Trademarks
âª Domain Name Families
âª Domain Names
When creating a Task for one of these objects, the fields from the fieldset 'Display on Task Page' will now be
displayed in the Related Record Details component.
Business Logic Added to Drop Date and Earliest Opposition Date
Business logic has been added for Drop Date and Earliest Opposition Date fields on Patent and Trademark objects.
For more information, see Field Library (on page 738).

IPfolio Summer '22
Integrated Invention Screening
The Summer '22 release brings several new integrations with other Clarivate products - most importantly
with Innography. IPfolio customers also using Innography have the possibility to conduct integrated Invention
Screenings, and thereby filter out inventions that are clearly not novel.
The semantic search for prior art will be based on the following Invention Disclosure fields:
âª Title
âª Short Description
âª Problem Solved
âª Novel Features
âª Advantages
âª Disadvantages
The results - covering the jurisdictions US, JP, CN, KR, WO, EP and DE - can then be reviewed, and according Prior
Art records and relations can be created for the ones considered relevant for the invention.
For further information, see Invention Disclosures (on page 475).
Emails
Page 116
IPfolio User Guide
Record-Specific Templates
For our core objects, it is now possible to group user templates into separate folders, depending on the related
record type:
âª User Templates - Invention Disclosures
âª User Templates - Patents
âª User Templates - Trademarks
Based on the record type a new email is created in, the system now tries to provide the creator with the most
suitable template(s) available, instead of having them go through the full list of configured email templates.
New Email Settings
System administrators now have access to a new "Email Settings"tab in the IPfolio Admin Panel, providing
additional configuration options for your email correspondence.
âª Org Email Address - Replies to emails sent from the Documents section normally go to the Sender/current 
user. If an email is added here and recipients are instructed to "Reply All", the replies go to the Sender and the
Documents section of the respective record.
âª Core Custom Objects - Any core custom objects entered here as a comma-separated list will have imported
files, inbound emails, and costs mapped to the record name/ID.
âª Activate Lightning Email Composer - If activated, email creation from the documents component will open a 
pop-up within the record view. If deactivated, email creation will open in a new screen.
âª Use Org Wide Email in SendEmail - If deactivated, it will use the currently logged-in user as Sender when 
creating emails from the Documents section. If activated, it will use the organization-wide address as the 
Sender. Additionally, the address must be added to the âOrg Email Addressâ custom setting field.
âª Do Not Display Email Headers - If activated, received emails no longer show headers on mouseover or
download.
âª Customer Signature - Text used in email templates/Visualforce pages e.g. The IPfolio Patent Team
âª Email Autocomplete From Parties & Contacts - By default, only Parties are considered for the outbound email
address autocomplete. This setting, once checked, extends autocomplete to Contacts as well.
Page 117
| 1 - What's New
Extended Recipient Selection
Several recipient options have been added to the Lightning email creator (auto-complete) for selecting recipients
when sending an email from a record.
The option All Inventors has been added to Invention Disclosures.
The options In-House Counsel, Law Firm and Firm Attorney have been added to the following objects:
In-House Counsel: Law Firm and Firm Attorney:
Brands Activities
Conflicts Brands
Contracts Conflicts
Copyrights Contracts
Domain Name Families Copyrights
Domain Names General Matters
General Matters Inventions
Inventions Invention Disclosures
Invention Disclosures Mining Sessions

Patent Review Projects Trademark Search Requests
Products Trademarks
Reviews
Third Party Trademarks
Trademark Filing Instructions
Trademark Search Requests
Trademarks
Additional CC Recipients
Some customers wanted to use the CC field in emails to add the addresses of Inventors.
As the Org Email Address is used for CC fields, and additional email addresses cannot be added (comma-separated)
in the Org Email Address field, the custom setting âAdditional cc Recipientsâ has been created.
The email addresses on this custom setting are now used in the CC field additionally to the Org Email Address.
Patents
New Folder for IDF Attachments in Patent Family
When a Patent is created from an IDF, both the documents in "Attachments" and "Documents" are automatically
copied into the Documents section on the Patent under âIDF Attachmentsâ. The same has now been implemented
consistently at Patent Family level.
Page 118
IPfolio User Guide
3rd Party Patent Objects Now Available
It is now possible to manage 3rd Party Patents and 3rd Party Patent Families in IPfolio:
âª 3rd Party Patent Family: Required for hosting 3rd party patent family data like Derwent title and abstract, and
linking the familyâs IP rights together
âª 3rd Party Patent: Required for hosting 3rd party patent data for use cases other than Prior Art and IDS, e.g. for 
monitoring and assessing 3rd party patents or filing oppositions
The Prior Art object now links to the Patent record, the 3rd Party Patent record, and the Innography record.
The new fields and objects are part of the IP Superuser fieldset.
Prior Art Creation Now from IP ONE Data (Instead of OPS)
When creating Prior Art records via "Add Multiple Prior Art" on the Relations tab (see Create Prior Art Records (on
page 274)), the Prior Art data is now synchronized with IP ONE Data instead of OPS.
Derwent and PatentScout Links on Patent Records
New external links are available on Patent records.
Derwent
A new Link to Derwent field is now available in the Links section of Patent records. This link is generated using the
publication or grant number from the Patent record, and opens a new web page to the public information available
in Derwent.
PatentScout
In a addition to the Derwent link, also a Link to PatentScoutis now available on Patent records as part of the IP
Superuser permission set. PatentScout is an alternative to Google Patents as seen below:
Page 119
| 1 - What's New
No Propagation of PCT Information in Case of Priority Patents
Generally, the following fields are propagated from a WO record to its child records:
âª PCT Filing Date
âª PCT Application Number
âª PCT Receiving Office
âª PCT Search Authority
The only exception to this rule has been if the child itself was a WO. In this case we would not propagate any of these
values to the child.
We have now added a second scenario when we do not propagate the values. Going forward, we also do not
propagate them if the childâs relationship to the parent is âClaims Priorityâ.
New Fields for Assignment Cost and Ownership Shares
We have added several new fields related to the Assignee object:
âª Assignment Cost Share - cost-sharing between Owners of the Patent
âª All Assignment Cost Shares - list of Assignment Cost Share values from the Assignee related list
âª All Assignment Ownership Shares - list of Ownership Percentages from the Assignee related list
These fields are useful in countries (like Japan) where it is common for multiple companies to co-own a patent and
share ownership and costs in the patent.
Page 120
IPfolio User Guide
Like other âallâ fields, All Assignment Cost Shares and All Assignment Ownership Shares are updated automatically
as customers edit records in the Assignee related list. Customers can also backfill the fields using the Business Logic
Execution Tool. (BLET > Patent > Re-calculate Assignee (Owner) related fields).
Records
New Data Audit for Employee ID
A new Data Audit has been introduced, checking if the Employee ID is correct for a given User account and Contact.
It informs you, for example, if an Employee ID exists on the User account but not on the related Contact.
The Data Audit is based on a new matching mechanism that ensures the correct alignment of the three "personal 
information objects"in IPfolio (User, Contact and Party). By default, these objects are matched by Email address. 
However, there is also the option to match them by Employee ID instead.
For more information, see Record Matching (on page 525) in the User Guide.
New Fields on Patent and Trademark Records
Three new fields are now available on Patent and Trademark records:
Field Help Text Logic
Drop 
Date
Date when the IP right is no longer actively maintained due 
to abandonment or lapse. This date relates to an internal decision to stop maintenance and could be much earlier than 
the actual lapse date.
Populated by IPfolio to the current date
when a user sets the Maintenance Status to 
âInactiveâ or the Pay field on a related Renewal record to âNoâ.
Acquisition 
Date
Date when the IP right was acquired from another party Manually populated
Earliest 
Opposition 
Date
Earliest opposition date that this IP right was involved in Populated by IPfolio to the earliest Initiation Date of related Conflicts with Conflict 
Type = âOppositionâ and Stance = âDefensiveâ
Relations between Same Record Types
It is now possible to create general links between same-type objects in IPfolio. This functionality has been enabled
for the following record types:
âª Conflicts
âª General Matters
âª Invention Disclosures
âª IP Contracts
âª Patent Review Projects
Page 121
| 1 - What's New
âª Patents
âª Trademarks
Whenever creating a link between two of these objects, an according âinverse linkâ will be created in the
background - making sure the relation is transparent and accessible from both of the related objects. Whenever
deleting the link from one of the objects, it will also delete the inverse relationship.
Note that the creation and deletion of inverse links happen via batch runs, meaning that the changes will not
become active immediately.
General Matter Relations
In addition to Patent and Trademark records, General Matters can now also be linked to the following IPfolio
objects:
âª Contracts
âª Invention Disclosures
âª Patent Families
âª Products
Images for Party Records
The âRecord Imageâ functionality has been added to the Party object. This allows users to store images of people
(for example, inventors) on Party records.
Page 122
IPfolio User Guide
For more information, see Record Image (on page 201) in the User Guide.
Trademarks
New Search Bar in Trademark Filing Instructions
The National Filing Countries and WIPO Filing Countries on the Trademark Filing Instructions form are long lists
that make selecting countries difficult.
New search fields now let you filter by Country Code and Country Name to make finding and selecting countries
easier.
Page 123
| 1 - What's New
Extended CompuMark Sync Matching Logic
Before we can populate IPfolio records with CompuMark data, we need to find the right external record. To be able
to find and match as many external records as possible, we have made some changes to the matching logic:
âª In addition to Filing Date, Jurisdiction/Country and Application Number, two more fields are now used for 
matching Trademark records:
âª Registration Date and
âª Registration Number
âª Different combinations of formatted/unformatted versions of various CompuMark numbers are now tried 
when matching records, as the required formatting of numbers can be very particular and can even change from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
âª In addition to these extensions, also a new Data Audit has been introduced: If the incoming Filing Date now 
differs from the IPfolio Filing Date, the matching does no longer fail by default. Instead, the Data Audit suggests
the new CompuMark Date to the user. If the user accepts, the sync re-runs, and the record is matched.
For more information on the CompuMark Matching Logic, see Sync Details (on page 323) in the User Guide.
General Salesforce Enhancements
Customizable and Filterable Related Lists
Customize related lists directly from the Lightning App Builder instead of the page layout editor with the new
Dynamic Related List â Single component. Choose the listâs fields and sort order, apply filters, and give the list a
descriptive name. To see the most relevant records, set up two or more related lists with different filters on the
same object.
For more information, see the related Salesforce Summer â22 Release Notesand Salesforce Admin Blog.
Custom Address Fields (Beta)
Configure custom Address fields that combine multiple sources for address-related information (Country, State,
City, Street, Postal Code). Users can populate a custom address field manually, or they can use the Google lookup to
search for an address.
For more information, see the related Salesforce Summer â22 Release Notes.
IPfolio Spring '22
Trademark Maintenance Decision Flow
Getting stakeholder feedback on maintenance decisions can be tedious and time consuming, especially for
customers with large portfolios. Our new automated Trademark Maintenance Decision Flow makes this process
easier by moving the entire renewal review process âinto the systemâ alongside your TM Renewal records.
The Trademark Maintenance Decision Flow:
Page 124
IPfolio User Guide
âª Removes the need to manage and maintain complex Excel spreadsheets outside the system.
âª Improves the accuracy and efficiency of the decision-making process.
âª Facilitates decision-making by walking key stakeholders and decision-makers through a series of predefined
steps.
This comprehensive solution includes a âSetup Flowâ that helps you create a custom review schedule. It also
includes a âScheduler Flowâ that monitors your renewals and automatically notifies stakeholders when action is
required. When final decisions are made, they automatically flow into the renewals system for further processing.
TM Renewal with Stakeholder Feedback
See Trademark Maintenance Decision Flow (on page 452) for details.
IP Right Bulk Tagging
Our new IP Right Bulk Tagging feature lets you bulk tag patents and designs and generate reports based on the tags.
Bulk Tagging is designed to bypass Salesforce limitations that make bulk tagging, filtering, and reporting on IP Rights
difficult.
The module includes:
Page 125
| 1 - What's New
âª âCustom Tagsâ, a new object for managing tags.
âª âBulk Taggingâ, a new object for tracking applied tags.
âª âBulk Tag Patents/Designs Reportâ, a new report type specially designed for bulk tag reports.
The module also includes a new âIP Right Bulk Taggingâ custom page that makes applying tags easy.
List of IP Rights to Tag
See IP Right Bulk Tagging (on page 287) for details.
IDS Module Enhancements
We have expanded and enhanced the IDS Module.
âª Patent/publication prior art data and prior art copy retrieval is now powered by IP ONE Data.
âª You can cite prior art on invention disclosures as well as patents.
âª We added a dedicated non-patent prior art view to manage non-patent prior art citations, and added new
functionality to cite patents from within non-patent prior art.
âª You can download prior art copies individually or in bulk. A new document icon shows when a cited prior art has
a document available for download.
Cited Prior Art with Documents Available for Download.
See IDS Module (on page 268) for details.
New Derwent Integration
We are pleased to announce a new integration with Derwent. Derwent offers a range of IP data services.
Currently, our Derwent data feed automatically populates the following IPfolio patent fields with data from 
Derwent:
Page 126
IPfolio User Guide
âª Derwent Abstract
âª Derwent Class
âª Derwent Title
We intend to expand and enhance the integration soon.
Note: Derwent is a paid service.
New âGenericâ Review Object
We have created a new âgenericâ Review object. The new Review object lets you manage reviews from multiple
documents in one place.
The new Review object works with:
âª Patents
âª Contracts
âª General Matters
âª Patent Review Projects
The new object supports:
âª Categorizations
âª e-Billing
âª Documents
Note: Customers using the existing Patent Review (on page 234) object can continue to do so.
Redesigned Approve for Filing Functionality
We have created a new flow-based Approve for Filing process that supersedes the existing (Visualforce-based)
process. You can revisit categorizations, assign a law firm, set due dates, and provide instructions.
The new flow has an improved user interface, including:
âª Lightning look-and-feel.
âª No duplicate buttons.
Flows have other important advantages too:
âª You can use the included flow template as is, or create a copy and customize it.
âª You can add, remove, or re-arrange fields.
âª You can embed a screen flow in a Lightning Record Page.
Page 127
| 1 - What's New
New orgs use the new âIDF - Approve for Filing Flow Templateâ by default. With minor configuration, existing orgs
can use the new flow too.
Approve for Filing Flow
The Create First Patent Filing (on page 473) section of the IPfolio User Guide has been updated to reflect these 
changes.
Send Email from Record â New Lightning Component
The new âSend Email from Recordâ Lightning web component brings several usability improvements over the
existing Visualforce page.
âª The editor is conveniently located in the right panel. It can also be expanded into an overlay.
âª The editor lets you add the record owner, inventors, and others to the record.
âª The editor uses the Standard Salesforce uploader which is easier to use and less restrictive.
Page 128
IPfolio User Guide
Send Email Lightning â Popup
See Send Email â Lightning (on page 185) for details.
IP Portal
New âRecord Edit Formâ
We continue to expand and enhance our portal offerings.
We have created a new Record Edit Form, available on the Lightning Portal. Record Edit Form is a Lightning Web
Component that features a single-page format that includes documents and inventors. It is easier to setup and
configure than comparable options.
The new component includes advanced autosave functionality. Autosave occurs 2 seconds after the last activity and
is seamless â the page doesnât reload, refresh or otherwise disrupt ongoing work.
Enable Image Component on Lightning Portal
The Image for Display component displays the record image on invention disclosures, patents, and other records.
The Image for Display component is now available in the Lightning portal.
Patents
Patent Suffix Configuration: No Suffix
When naming a new patent, the system uses the Relationship to Parent value to lookup the correct suffix in the 
Patent Suffix Configuration custom metadata. The custom metadata records include a default value, and a Custom 
Suffix field that you can use to override the default.
Adding a Custom Suffix value of â[NONE]â prevents the system from adding a suffix for a given record type.
See Patent Names (on page 521) for details.
Page 129
| 1 - What's New
Extended Family Field
We have added an Extended Family field to patents. Use Extended Family to indicate that patents in separate
families are closely related.
âª Extended Family starts with the same value as Patent Family.
âª We update Extended Family on all members of a family where one patent has been terminally disclaimed by a
patent of an earlier family.
See Extended Family (on page 738) for details.
PortfolioIQ
PortfolioIQ: Third Party IP Rights
PortfolioIQ is an Innography feature that lets you add private data to Innography. PortfolioIQ:
âª Adds private records like unpublished patent applications and invention disclosures to Innography.
âª Adds private IPfolio fields to public and private records in Innography.
Recently, a customer asked if Third Party Patents (a patent with the Third Party attribute selected) are copied to 
PortfolioIQ.
The value of the Third Party field on a patent isnât considered by the PortfolioIQ logic. Included patents are copied
regardless of whether Third Party is selected.
Trademarks
TMFI: Delete Class by Jurisdiction
Our TM Filing Instruction feature makes creating foreign filing records easier.
TM Filing Instructions now includes an interactive âApplicable Countriesâ column that gives you much more control
over how Classes & Goods propagate to foreign filing records.
See Trademark Foreign Filing Process (on page 314) for details.
CompuMark
Page 130
IPfolio User Guide
CompuMark Match: Disambiguate Search Results
The CompuMark Match search API uses wildcards that can return multiple results for a single search.
Until recently, we didnât disambiguate records when we received multiple results. Going forward, when the search
API returns multiple records, we iterate over each to find the correct record using the CompuMark Match text API 
to check the Application Number of each.
Data Feeds
IP ONE Data Sync Fails Due to Validation Rule
A validation rule on patents requires a priority date to be entered when entering a filing date. The validation rule 
generates an error if the priority date is missing regardless of how the filing date is populated, including during an IP
ONE Data sync. We have improved the error message to make it easier to find and correct the record.
Docketing
Document Records: Related Record Details
Document records now show details from related patents and trademarks.
âª A new field set on patents and trademarks controls which fields show in the component on the Document
record.
âª The component shows only if the related record is a patent or trademark.
See Related Record Details (on page 438) for details.
Show Preview in Documents
The Documents Lightning Record Page now previews the related file.
Page 131
| 1 - What's New
âª The Documents standard view now includes a split view, with details on a preview of the related file on the right.
âª The preview works for the following extensions: .docx, .pdf, .ppt, .pptx, .xls, .xlsx, .gif, .jpg, and .png.
Note: This applies to the Documents tab, not the Documents section found on individual records.
DocketEngine: Append Comments
We have changed how Comments are populated when you select multiple DocketEngine tasks and enter a new
comment. We now append the new comment to existing comments.
âª For selected tasks where Comments is empty, the result is the new comment is added.
âª For selected tasks where Comments has a value, we append the new comment to the existing comment(s).
Renewals
Instruct Renewals on Service Level
Previously, our renewals integration only allowed for autopay clients. We now support making renewal decisions on
a per-service level.
For autopay customers, decisions are made at the case level. When no instruction is given, a payment is made.
To make renewal decisions on per-service level, weâve created a new Disable Autopay custom setting. When 
Disable Autopay is selected, customers instruct renewals on the service level, and pay/no pay instructions are
required.
Domain Names
Duplicate Record Rule Relaxed
Previously, our duplicate record rule allowed only one domain name extension per family. This worked for a domain
name family like:
Page 132
IPfolio User Guide
Domain Name Family ID Domain Name ID Extension
IPfolio IPfolio.com com
IPfolio IPfolio.net net
IPfolio IPfolio.org org
However, this duplicate rule turned out to be too strict for a domain name family like:
Domain Name Family ID Domain Name ID Extension
IPfolio IPfolio.com com
IPfolio IPfolio-IP.com com
IPfolio IPfolio-IP-Software.com com
We changed the rule so only records with the same Domain Name ID are flagged. With the new rule, neither family
would violate duplicate record rules.
Category Tree
Category Trees Now Available for Copyright Records
Category Trees are now available on Copyright records.
Harmonize UI for Sync and Async Category Trees
IPfolio offers separate âsyncâ and âasyncâ category trees.
âª The âsyncâ category tree is used for smaller trees (with fewer categories).
âª The âasyncâ category tree is used for larger trees (with thousands of categories).
While the two are similar, there are subtle differences, mostly there to make the async tree work with very large
trees. These differences aside, we have harmonized the UI of the sync and async category trees.
Clarify Unsaved Changes Prompt
When browsing away from the category tree with unsaved changes:
âª You are prompted to save the changes if you browse to a different record.
âª You are not prompted to save changes if you browse to a different tab on the same record.
This is the correct behavior, but the text of the âsave changesâ message is misleading. It states, âIf you leave this tab, 
you will lose your changes.â That is misleading.
âª You do not lose your changes if you change tabs.
âª You do lose your changes if you change records.
Unfortunately, we use standard Salesforce functionality for this feature and we canât change the body of the 
message. However, we can change the title of the message which we have. The title now reads, âSave changes in
Category Tree before leaving this record?â.

Family Tree
Family Graph Field Set
Hovering over a node in the Family Tree shows details of the underlying record. You can modify the âFamily Graph
Fieldsâ field set to control which fields show when hovering over a node.
Documents
Delete Related Documents If File Is Deleted
When you add a file to the Documents section of a record:
âª The actual file is stored as a File (ContentDocument) record.
âª The âfileâ you see in Documents is a reference to the (ContentDocument) record.
To prevent âorphansâ (a reference to file that donât exist, or a file with no references), we delete a file when the last
reference to it is deleted. Now, we also delete all references when the file is deleted.
Issue Tracker
Create New Record Using Flow
Historically, we used a custom Visualforce page to create new Issue Tracker records. Due to limitations with
Visualforce, this made adding screenshots to the Issue Description rich text field difficult.
We have replaced the Visualforce page with a Flow. Now, when creating a new Issue Tracking record:
âª A flow launches. The flow lets you add images to the Issue Description field.
âª On save, you redirect to the issue tracking record.
âª The object setting counter is incremented properly.
Tasks
Related Record Details
The Related Record Details component shows patent and trademark fields on related tasks.
Page 134
IPfolio User Guide
Note: Related Record Details shows details for related patents and trademarks only. The component is
automatically hidden on tasks related to other objects.
Data
Backfill âAll Contractsâ
By default, the system updates All Contracts on patents by running a scheduled job monthly. You can schedule the
job to run daily or perform an ad hoc update anytime.
See All Contracts (on page 553) for details.
PCT Application Number and PCT Filing Date
Normally, the system sets the PCT Application Number and PCT Filing Date to the value of the WO ancestor on 
WO descendants that are not WOs themselves as you work. But it is possible for the values to be incorrect. (For
example, they can be set improperly during data imports.)
Use the Business Logic Execution Tool to update the PCT Application Number and PCT Filing Date on WO 
descendants.
See PCT Application Number and PCT Filing Date (on page ) for details.
Reports
Inline Editing in Reports
When you run a report, the report accurately shows the values as they appear in your records. Until now, to update
a report value, you need to change the value in the underlying record and re-run the report.
The new Inline Editing in Reports feature lets you update certain text, numeric, and checkbox fields without leaving
the Report Run page.
See Edit Multiple Fields Inline on the Report Run Page (Beta) for details.

Visualization
New Lightning World Map
We have updated the World Map component.
âª The new map uses the Robinson projection.
âª Clicking a country now shows significantly more information too. (You now see tables with data from related
records.)
Details
The new component is set as the default on the packaged Lightning Home Page. (It is also used in our new
Automated Trademark Match module.)
Page 136
IPfolio User Guide
Lightning World Map Improvements
The World Map component weâve used until now worked well. However, it made external API calls that were
problematic in some regions. We have implemented a new World Map that is attractive and doesnât make external
calls. Weâve made other adjustments/improvements, including:
âª Filtering the Lightning World Map by Status applies the same color coding to the countries as in the old 
Visualforce World Map
âª Clicking on a country lists Patents and Trademarks, grouped by Type of IP
Additionally, clicking a country now shows significantly more information too. Instead of showing record IDs only,
you now see tables showing related records.
Implementation Details
The new component is set as the default on the packaged Lightning Home Page. (It is also used in our new
Automated Trademark Match module.)
Page 137
| 1 - What's New
Please also see Visualizations (on page 507).
Category Tree
Include Category Type in All Categories
When the Include Category Type in All Categories custom setting is selected, IPfolio prepends the appropriate 
category type to categorizations listed in All Categories.
We noticed that when a record had multiple categorizations, category type was only prepended to the first
categorization. This has been fixed.
Going forward, when a record has multiple categorizations, and the Include Category Type in All Categories custom 
setting is selected, the appropriate Category Type will be prepended to each categorization in All Categories.
New âImmediate Savingâ Option on Category Tree
Currently, when you select a category in the Category Tree IPfolio creates a categorization record in real time.
There is a small delay as IPfolio creates the record. This isnât a problem for many, but it can be annoying for some,
particularly when you select multiple categories per record.
We have created a new Immediate saving option for the sync Category Tree.
âª When Immediate saving is enabled, IPfolio creates/deletes categorization records normally.
âª When Immediate saving is disabled, you select multiple categories then click Save Changes to save all changes at
once.
Note: This feature is available on the sync category tree only.
Show More Categories on Async Category Tree
The async Category Tree is designed for large treesââ those with thousands of categories.
One way it handles large trees is by limiting the number of categories shown in each view. By default, the async tree
shows 10 categories. To see more categories, users click Show more.
Page 138
IPfolio User Guide
Showing ten categories is arbitraryââ we picked it because it seemed like a reasonable default.
We have added a Tree Page Size option to the async Category Trees that lets you change the number of categories
that show before you need to Show more.
Details
To set Tree Page Size:
âª Select Edit Page.
âª Select the Category Tree (asynchronous) component.
âª Adjust Tree Page Size as needed.
Please also see Category Tree (on page 165).
IP One Data
New Patent Fields
Weâve added two new patent fields:
âª All CPC Classes is a list of Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) Symbols.
âª All IPC Classes is a list of International Patent Classification (IPC) Symbols.
These fields are auto populated by IPfolio with IP ONE Data.
Details
âª The fields are comma-delimited and sorted in ascending order.
âª IP ONE Data is required.
Please also see IP One Data (on page 298).

IP Portal
Add Related Record Detail Component to Lightning Portal
You can now add a Related Record Detail component to the Lightning portal.
Please also see IP Portal (on page 205).
Patents
Adjust Standard Expiration Date for Foreign Divisional Patents
We have adjusted the Standard Expiration Date calculation for foreign divisional patents. Going forward, Standard 
Expiration Date = Filing Date + 20 years for foreign divisional patents.
Table: Foreign Divisional Patents
Field Value

Custom Inventor Display Order
For the Reorder component to work properly, make sure:
âª The Order field is shown in the Inventors related list.
âª The Inventors related list is set to sort by Order.
Page 140
IPfolio User Guide
See Inventors (on page 237) for details.
Please also see Patents (on page 473).
Trademarks
New Trademark Search Requests Features
We continue to add important functionality to Trademark Search Requests. Most recently we have:
âª Added a âSubmitterâ sharing reason.
âª Added Editable TSR Statuses custom setting.
âª Added sharing re-evaluation logic in the TSR trigger, which only triggers on relevant changes (Status or
Submitter changes).
The Editable TSR Statuses custom setting, for example, lets you set the statuses in which portal users can edit a TSR
record.
Page 141
| 1 - What's New
See Trademark Search Requests (on page 306) for details.
Add Lookup Filters to Trademarks
Lookup filters improve productivity and data quality by restricting selections to valid values. The following patent
fields lookup filters:
Field Lookup Filter Reason
Law Firm Party Type = Law Firm Show law firms only
Firm Attorney
Parent Party = Law
Firm
Show attorneys from correct firm only
We have added these same lookup filters to the Law Firm and Firm Attorney fields on trademarks.
Please also see Trademarks (on page 311).
CompuMark
Refine CompuMark API Import Logic
The CompuMark API populates the IPfolio Cancelled/Abandoned Date field on trademarks. Since adding a
Cancelled/Abandoned Date sets the Status (High-Level) to âLapsedâ, it is important that Cancelled/Abandoned 
Date isnât populated prematurely.
Going forward, the CompuMark integration populates Cancelled/Abandoned Date only if:
âª CompuMark.abandonmentDate != null AND CompuMark.cmNormalisedStatus = âAbandonedâ, or
âª CompuMark.cancellationDate != null AND cmNormalisedStatus = âCancelledâ or âExpiredâ.
Note: When setting Cancelled/Abandoned Date, we also set the IPfolio Lapse Reason field to âAbandonedâ,
âCancelledâ, or âExpiredâ appropriately using the CompuMark cmNormalisedStatus field value.
Page 142
IPfolio User Guide
Please also see CompuMark (on page 320).
IDS
Refine Prior Art Imports
Given a list of WO Publication Numbers, our Add Multiple Prior Art feature retrieves multiple prior art records.
Recently, when given a set of 40 publication numbers, 3 didnât return results.
âª Two failed because the URL returned by the API was too long which resulted in a error. Going forward, we are
truncating the API results at 255 characters which reduces errors.
âª One failed because the WO publication number was incorrect. Using the correct format resolved this issue. For
example:
âª From 1978 until 30 June 2002, the format was YY##### (two-digit year and five-digit number).
âª From 1 July 2002 to 31 December 2003, it was YY###### (two-digit year and six-digit number).
Please also see IDS (on page 268).
ELM
New Invoice Object
Weâve created an Invoice object you can use to group cost records. Using the Invoice object is optional.
Note: The Invoice object is required for those using our SimpleLegal Cost Import feature.
SimpleLegal Cost Import
Historically, our SimpleLegal integration has been one wayââ that is, we send data to SimpleLegal. We continue to
push data to SimpleLegal as we have in the past, however, we now pull cost data too.
The enhanced SimpleLegal integration:
âª Creates individual Cost records.
âª Creates Invoice records (using a new Invoice object) that group the Cost records.
âª We automatically create associated Party records as needed.
The enhanced integration uses a new SimpleLegal API.
Please also see ELM (on page 470).

Add In-House Counsel, Record Owner Fields to Documents
We have added two new fields, In-House Counsel and Record Owner to the Document (IPfolio__Attachment__c) 
object. Adding these fields makes it possible to filter/sort/report on Documents using these values.
Details
âª In-House Counsel and Record Owner are Lookup fields.
âª IPfolio auto-populates In-House Counsel and Record Owner when you add documents to patents and
trademarks.
Page 144
IPfolio User Guide
âª IPfolio auto-updates In-House Counsel and Record Owner on related documents when you update either value
on a patent or trademark.
âª You can use the Business Logic Execution Tool to backfill these values on existing documents.
Make Portal Documents Component Available in IPfolio
The portal Documents component only shows documents submitted by portal users. This is by design.
Historically, the portal Documents component was available on the portal only. A customer wanted to limit the
documents committee members could see too. Going forward, you can add the portal Documents component to
invention disclosures too, making it easy to limit documents shown to committee members or others.
Please also see Documents (on page 175).
Email
Multiple Recipients for Emails to Inventors
The CC Address for Emails to Inventors custom setting lets you add recipients to the Emailto Inventors email sent 
from invention disclosures and patents.
Weâve added the ability to enter multiple recipients (in a comma separated list) to the custom setting.
Email to Inventorsââ Prioritize Contact Email Address
When you add the API name of an email template to the Emailto Inventors field on invention disclosures/patents,
IPfolio sends an email to the inventors using the template.
When sending the email to an inventor, IPfolio has to choose which email address to use: the email address on the
inventor record or the email address on the contact record.
âª Until recently we prioritized the inventor record email address to send the email.
âª We now prioritize the Contact email address since it is likely to be more current.
Please also see Email (on page 184).

IPfolio is simple and intuitive to use. Take some time to get to know the basics of the user interface.
Introduction
IPfolio is an end-to-end IP management solution that helps corporate IP groups of all sizes protect and manage
intellectual property.
IPfolio enhances visibility into your IP portfolio, reduces administrative overhead, and enables you to manage your
IP strategically by tying IP assets to products, markets, and revenue streams.
IPfolio is a cloud-based service built on Salesforce (https://www.salesforce.com), one of the most trusted, reliable 
and secure cloud platforms. There is no software to install and no hardware to purchase. All you need is an internet
connection and a modern browser.
IPfolio is designed to be easy to use. Please contact usfor additional help.
Welcome to IPfolio!
Control Your IP Assets
IPfolio organizes all IP assets and related activities â patents, trademarks, parties, documents, and moreââ in one 
secure, globally accessible location.
IPfolio helps you understand what has happened, what is coming up, and how assets relate to each other.
SubmitInvention Disclosures
The IPfolio Inventor Portal is accessible to all employees, so everyone can become an innovator. The invention
disclosure form guides inventors through the process of describing and submitting their inventions, making it easy
for engineers, scientists, and researchers to share details about their work. Optionally, IPfolio's standard submission
and review process can be customized to match your unique needs.
Streamline Your Invention Review Process
âª New disclosures and file attachments go straight into your database.
âª IPfolio sends confirmation emails to inventors on submission and enables them to track the progress of their
inventions on the portal.
Automate Your Docket
Our premium IPsync feature compares the bibliographic data in your IPfolio records with data from external
sources like the USPTO. IPsync displays data discrepancies for included fields on eligible records, making it easy for
you to accept or discard proposed changes directly on the record.
IPsync downloads all available prosecution documents and processes them to make them text searchable in IPfolio.
You can even configure tasks and reminders to be triggered automatically from downloaded documents.
Find Anything Quickly
IPfolio Global Search scans the entire database, displaying matching records grouped by type (Patents and
Trademarks for example.) Global Search finds all documents with searchable text (including PDFs.)
Page 148
IPfolio User Guide
Organize Documents
IPfolio provides robust document management capabilities. You can:
âª Attach documents of any kind to records.
âª Organize documents in subfolders via drag-and-drop.
âª Filter documents by attributes such as date, author, language, or individual tags.
âª Send email from a record, and email into a specific record from outside the system.
Track Costs and Budgets
IPfolio lets you track costs for individual patents or trademarks, as well as patent or trademark families, or even
by cost type, business unit, and technology area. Budgeting reports help identify cost overruns and plan for future
periods.
Map IP to Your Business
IPfolio maps your IP assets to your business with powerful categorization tools:
âª Create single or multi-select drop-down fields to segment your portfolio, for example by business unit or
technology area.
âª Use the Products tab to maintain information about your companyâs products or product lines, and map IP
assets accordingly.
âª Use the Contracts tab for tracking IP-related agreements.
âª Use our powerful Category Tree feature for hierarchical data.
âª Use the Filing Strategy module to define and set up strategies for your IP applications in various jurisdictions
and in different filing phases.
Collaborate Across Your Organization
IPfolio comes with a powerful Enterprise Social Network built-in. Users can collaborate and share information using
familiar social network features.
Note: Some features may require a small implementation project to use. Please contact usfor details.
IPfolio Log In
You can access IPfolio either through your companyâs single sign-on portal, or by entering your IPfolio username and

Single Sign-On (SSO)
Single Sign-On (SSO) is a user authentication service that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set
of login credentials.
SSO makes accessing IPfolio both easier and more secure â we strongly recommend it.
With SSO your username and password are managed through SSO, not through IPfolio.
Direct Log in
Your IT group may configure outside counsel or others to login directly.
To login to IPfolio directly, go to https://login.salesforce.com to sign-in, and then enter your IPfolio username and
password. (Your IPfolio username has the form of an email address.)
Note: Direct login users can only be deactivated manually by IPfolio administrators.
Important: Administrators should work with the IT group to ensure user access is set properly.
Changing Your Password or Security Question
If you login to IPfolio directly (and not through SSO), you can manage your username and password in IPfolio.
In addition to the procedure below, you can also reset your password by clicking Forgot your password? on the login 
page and following the instructions.
Page 150

needed, so if you would like to personalize your Home page, please contact your System Administrator.
A. Global Search
Global search is the best way to find information in IPfolio. Global search works like your favorite search engineâ
â enter your search terms, and global search performs a full-text search on your entire database, including
documents.
IPfolio displays results for all items initially. If you want to search a specific item (patents, publications, reportsâ¦),
select the required item in the box on the left of the search box.

Tabs serve as the starting point for viewing, editing, and entering information for a particular object.
The Navigation Bar is powerful and flexible.
âª Drag-and-drop to rearrange tabs.
âª Use the pencil icon on the right to add new tabs, rename tabs, and more.
âª Use the drop-down arrow on each tab to see recent records or create new records.
See Personalize Navigation (Video)
C. Tasks
Tasks are used throughout IPfolio. For example, DocketEngine customers see docketing tasks assigned to them in
the Todayâs Tasks list on the Home page. Other customers use tasks in a more ad-hoc way. Regardless, tasks are a
powerful, convenient multi-purpose tool in IPfolio.
D. Quicklinks
The Sidebar contains shortcuts to common features in IPfolio in the following groups:
Organize
This area contains the Open User Guide link to the online version of this User Guide.
Visualize
In this section Reports and Dashboards can be found.
Reports let you filter, sort, and illustrate your data in IPfolio with lists and charts. You can combine
several reports into a dashboard.
Typically, you will group thematically related reports into one dashboard. Alternatively, you may
create different dashboards for different groups of information recipients within your organization.
For example, the general counsel or whoever you report to, top management, and the R&D or business
organization.
IPfolio comes with a robust set of pre-defined reports and dashboards. You can create additional
custom reports as needed.
Strategize
This area contains unique visualizations to help see your portfolio strategically.
E. Recent Records
This is the quickest way to revisit recently viewed patents, trademarks, and other records.
F. Homepage Dashboard
Dashboards summarize and display your IPfolio data in a graphical layout. Dashboards are based on reports.
Page 154
IPfolio User Guide
Records
A record in IPfolio is a record like in any database. Thus, a publication record is a record that contains information
about a publication item, a patent record â about a patent, etc.
Figure 2. Record Screen (for a patent)
A. Search
Search is the best way to find information in IPfolio. Search works like your favorite search engineââ

B. Navigation Bar
The Navigation Bar appears at the top of each page in IPfolio. Each tab represents a functional area
in IPfolio, like Patents and Trademarks. Clicking a tab takes you to a specific area of IPfolio, and shows
available Views.
Use a shortcut ( ) to create a new record, or go directly to a recently used list view.
C. Quick Actions
Page 155
| 2 - Getting Started
Quick Actions make it easy to complete common tasks. While the function of each Quick Action
varies, they all have a common purposeââ to save you time.
D. Key Fields
IPfolio provides an âat-a-glanceâ view of key fields at the top of each record. Some records include a
helpful visual representation of the recordâs current status.
E. Related Lists
In a relational database like IPfolio, the current record may have one or more related records. For
example, a patent may have one or more inventors, one or more renewal payments.
Each list of related records is generically called a related list. Related lists appear just above the
current recordâs details.
F. Fields
Fields are the basic building blocks of a record. Fields are where you store a given recordâs values.
On a patent, the Title, Application Number, and Issue Date are all examples of âregularâ fields. On
patents and trademarks, these fields are sometimes referred to as the recordâs âbibliographicâ data.
Fields are grouped in logical sections that you can show or hide as needed.
G. Record Highlights
Similar to Key Fields (on page 156), IPfolio highlights other important record details on the right of a 
given record. For example, on a patent, we use this space to show the front page image and the current
activities/tasks.
Customizing the Navigation Bar
The navigation bar appears at the top of each page in IPfolio and has tabs for modules like Patents and Trademarks.
Tabs serve as the starting point for viewing, editing, and entering information.
You can customize the navigation bar to include the items you require (Dashboards, Patents, Reports, Trademark
Familiesâ¦). To rearrange the order of tabs on the navigation bar, just drag and drop an item to the required place.
Page 156
IPfolio User Guide
1. On the navigation bar, click .
2. To remove an item from the navigation bar, click the X next to the item.
3. To add items, click Add more items.
4. Select the required item(s), and then click Add â¦ Nav Items.
List Views
List Views (or simply âviewsâ) are where you view and edit your records. List views may be created by your
administrator or other users. You can also create your own list views to display specific records.
You can open a recent list view by clicking an item in the navigation bar, and then selecting the required option
under Recent lists.
Page 157
| 2 - Getting Started
Alternatively to change list view from the one currently open, you can click the down arrow on the top left , and 
then select the required list view.

Page 158
IPfolio User Guide
If you want to pin the currently open list view, click next to it. It will then become the default list view, and open
when you select this type of record from the Navigation bar.
Constraints on List Views
âª You canât export data from a list view. To export data, use Reports instead.
âª You canât bulk delete records in a list view.
âª Changing a shared list view changes it for others too. Proceed with caution.
âª Some images displayed in the Trademark list views can be distorted for certain records. This is due to the fact
that the image size cannot be retrieved via CompuMark. The issue can be fixed manually per case: once the
affected record is opened, the system adjusts the settings, and the list view image for this specific case is shown 
correctly from that moment on.

Chapter 3. Core Features
Found in multiple objects and modules, IPfolio core features â including Families, Tasks, the Category Tree,
Documents, and Email â ensure you can manage your IP effectively and comprehensively.
Families
Families exist when a âparentâ record has one or more related âchildâ records.
Families effectively group records. They can make reporting easier, provide a place to track information common
to all âchildren,â count child records, and show things like First Filing Date for a patent family. Patent family and
trademark family records are notable examples.

Custom Fields
You can add custom fields to most IPfolio objects. While custom fields can hold virtually any type of data, they are
most commonly used to store customer-specific categorization of records.
The data in custom fields can include sophisticated validation rules, be derived from related fields and related
records, and be configured to appear in specific layouts. Additionally, custom fields support field-level security,
allowing you to control access based on profiles or permission sets.
Custom fields can be of various types, such as picklists, rich text areas, and formula fields, each serving different
purposes. For example, picklist fields allow users to select values from predefined lists, while formula fields calculate
values based on other field data.
By using custom fields, you can tailor IPfolio to meet your specific needs. Further information on custom fields can
be found in the official Salesforce Help, for example here.
Customizable Record Auto-Numbers
IPfolio can auto-create Record IDs using static values, environment variables like the current Calendar Year, Fiscal
Year, and even field values from the current record.
For example, a Patent Family ID could be âPF-BU1-19-12345â, where âPFâ is a static prefix, âBU1â is the value from
a Business Unit field on the Patent Family, â19â is the last 2 digits of the current Fiscal Year, and â12345â is next
available Patent Family number. This is available for All core objects except Invention Disclosures and Trademark
Search Requests.

Tasks
Tasks are used heavily in patents and trademarks, especially for customers using DocketEngine. But tasks are
âbaked intoâ IPfolio and can be used with most IPfolio objects.

Advanced Task Management (on page 432)
Parties
Associating people with records is usually done via party records.
For example, parties are used to associate inventors with patents. But parties are used to associate people with
records elsewhere too â on Conflicts, General Matters, and more.
Figure 6. Parties associated with a conflict
Chatter
Chatter is the secure corporate social network included with IPfolio.
The Chatter feed allows you to follow the activities of others in IPfolio. Chatter is a Corporate Social Network,
integrated into Salesforce. Chatter allows you to share information and collaborate, similar to the way you do on
social networks like Facebook and LinkedIn.
Family records have a Chatter feed, allowing you to comment, discuss and follow activity at the family level. You can
also conduct polls with Chatter. The polls also show up in the Chatter feed.
We can enable Chatter on Patents, Trademarks, Products, Contracts, and most other objects.
Page 162
IPfolio User Guide
This social capability allows for a collaborative approach to internal review and decision-making processes, such as
invention review boards.
Invite Colleagues to a Discussion
You can invite any IPfolio user to a discussion on a specific record by mentioning their name, preceded by the @
symbol, in a post. After typing a few characters following the @ symbol, a list will appear to help you select the
person you are looking for. This person will receive a notification and will automatically be made a Follower to this
record, which means she or he will be notified of further updates as the discussion thread evolves.

Category Tree
Category Trees are a powerful categorization tool suitable for associating terms, products, technologies, and other
classifications with your IPfolio records.
Category Trees feature a hierarchical data structure, with multi-select capabilities, and an elegant user interface
with powerful search.
Availability
Category Trees are available on the following objects:
âª Conflicts
âª Contracts
âª Copyrights
âª Design Rights and Design Families
âª Domain Names and Domain Name Families
âª General Matters
âª Invention Disclosures
âª Mining Sessions
âª Patent Review Projects

âª Trademark Search Requests
Category Tree Elements
All category trees consist of Category Types, Categories, and Categorizations.
Category types
Category Types are high-level category groupings. Category trees can have one or more Category
Types. Category Types donât have a checkbox and canât be selected.
Categories
Categories are the basic organizational unit of a category tree. In a category tree, anything with a
checkbox that can be selected is a category. A category may contain other categories. Categories that
donât contain other categories are sometimes referred to as âleafâ categories.
Important:
Category Names
âª If the Category name contains a quotation mark (") â e.g., John Johnson 13" MacBook 
Case â it will cause a Category Tree error, and you will not be able to add Categories to
any of the records. For the Category Tree to function properly, escape the quotation mark
with a backslash (\) â e.g., John Johnson 13\" MacBook Case. The escape character (\) will
not be displayed on the Category Tree.
âª Same-Name Categories
(supported by the Prevent Duplicate Category Names (Same-Parent Categories)
Duplicate Rule: Setup> enter 'Duplicate Rules' in the Quick Find box)
It is impossible to create
âª Two Categories with the same name and without a Parent Category within the same
Category Type (e.g., Category Type = Pharmaceutical, Category Name = API).
âª Two Categories with the same name and the same Parent Category within the same
Category Type (e.g., Category Type = Pharmaceutical, Parent Category = Formulation,
Category Name = Capsule).
It is possible to create
âª Two Categories with the same name if they have a different Parent Category (e.g.,
[Category Type = Pharmaceutical, Parent Category = Formulation, Category Name
= Capsule] and [Category Type = Pharmaceutical, Parent Category = API, Category
Name = Capsule]).
âª Two Categories with the same name if they have a different Category Type (e.g.,
[Category Type = Pharmaceutical, Category Name = API] and [Category Type =
Software, Category Name = API]).
Page 166
IPfolio User Guide
âª Two Categories with the same name if they have a Parent Category with the same
name but in a different Category Type (e.g., [Category Type = Pharmaceutical, Parent
Category = Formulation, Category Name = Capsule] and [Category Type = Software,
Parent Category = Formulation, Category Name = Capsule]).
Categorizations
Categorizations are selected categories. Adding a checkmark to a category creates a record in the 
related categorization table. Removing a checkmark deletes the categorization record from the
categorization table.
Example
In the following example, âCompetitive Coverageâ is a Category Type, âCompanyâ, âAppleâ and âiPadâ
are all categories, and a categorization record exists for each selected category..
Family and application records
Patents can generally be categorized either on the Patent level or on the Patent Family level. Either way, the
Category Tree of the Patent Family will represent the sum of all the current Categorizations selected across the
members of the Family.
Please note, however, that Categorizations made on the Family level will not be applied to the Patents belonging to
the Family and can be removed from the Family record only manually.
If a specific Categorization is made on the Patent level, it rolls up to the Patent Family. If it is later removed from all
the Patents belonging to a Family, it will be automatically removed from the superordinate Family record.
The same logic and behavior apply to Trademark/Trademark Family Categorizations.
Sync and Async Category Trees
There are two types of category tree: sync and async. The number of categories in your tree determines which type
you use.
All category trees consist of the same basic building blocks on the backend: Category Types, Categories, and
Categorizations.
We have two distinct Category Tree âfront-endsâ: Sync and Async.
Sync Category Tree
The âsyncâ category tree delivers a dynamic, interactive experience that works well for smaller trees.
âª When you visit the tree, nodes are typically expanded.
âª The Show More link is configurable â the number of Categories to be displayed can be adapted to your needs (to
adjust the configuration, please contact your System Administrator or the IPfolio Premium Services Team).
âª The tree is filtered in real-time as you enter search terms.
âª Best for trees with < ~500 nodes.
Page 167
| 3 - Core Features
Async Category Tree
The âasyncâ category tree is specifically designed to improve performance for larger trees.
âª When you visit the tree, nodes are collapsed (you expand nodes as needed). This divides the tree into smaller,
more manageable sections. There is, however, an option to have the async tree's nodes expanded, just like those
of the sync tree's. For the Auto Expand property to be enabled, please contact your System Administrator or the
IPfolio Premium Services Team.
âª The tree is not filtered as you type. Instead, you type a search term, then run the search.
âª Best for trees with > ~500 nodes.
Category Tree Features by Type
Table: Features available for the âsyncâ and âasyncâ Category Trees.
Feature Sync Tree Async Tree
Select Categories Single-select â â

Search Categories Dynamic Search â
Filter search by Category Type â
Save Selections Disable Immediate Save â
Display Categories expanded by default

Note:
âª If all the Category Types visible in the Category Tree are single-select, they are shown as single-select.
âª If it's a combination of single-select and multi-select Category Types, the tree is displayed as multiselect.
âª A Categorization record is created for every node marked on the single-select Category Tree - including
parent categories throughout the entire hierarchy.
Using the Sync Category Tree
The âsyncâ category tree delivers a dynamic, interactive experience that works well for smaller trees with fewer
than 500 nodes.
You need a properly configured sync category tree, and read/write access to the underlying record.
Important: Please make sure there are no double quotes ("-") used in the category names, otherwise you will
get an error message and the category tree will not be displayed.
When you visit the tree, nodes are typically expanded. The tree is filtered in real-time as you enter search terms.
1. Open the required record.
2. Select Categories.
3. Optional:
Page 168
IPfolio User Guide
To search for a category, enter a category name in Search.
More info: Categories are filtered dynamically as you type.
4. Select the required categories.
Result: By default, categorizations are saved as soon as you select/deselect them.
Disabling Immediate Saving of Categories
Administrators may prefer to disable immediate saving to avoid the delay when each categorization record is added
or deleted.
To perform this task you need Admin rights. You can only disable automatic saving on a Sync category tree.
By default, categorizations are saved as soon as you select/deselect them. There is a small delay as each
categorization record is added or deleted. You can disable âImmediate Savingâ to save multiple selects all at once.
Figure 7. Category tree with automatic saving disabled
1. Browse to the Lightning record page with the sync Category Tree.
2. Select Setup> Edit Page.
3. Select the Category Tree page.
Page 169
| 3 - Core Features
4. Select or deselect the Immediate saving option.
5. Optional: Select Show Category Type in Pills to display the Category Type in the Selected section.
6. Optional: Select Read only to make the Category Tree read only (on page 174).
Using the Async Category Tree
The âasyncâ category tree is specifically designed to improve performance for larger trees, with more than 500
nodes.
You need a properly configured async category tree, and read/write access to the underlying record.
Important: Please make sure there are no double quotes ("-") used in the category names, otherwise you will
get an error message and the category tree will not be displayed.
When you visit the tree, nodes are collapsed (you expand nodes as needed). This divides the tree into smaller, more
manageable sections. There is, however, an option to have the async tree's nodes expanded, just like those of the
sync tree's. For the Auto Expand property to be enabled, please contact your System Administrator or the IPfolio 
Premium Services Team.
The tree is not filtered as you type. Instead, you type a search term, then run the search.
Consider creating a report listing all categories so you can refer to it when searching for categories.
1. Open the required record.
2. Select Categories.
3. Optional: To restrict the search to a specific category type, select the required Category Type in the Filter 
By box.
4. Enter a search term, preferably a specific category name, in the Search box, and then press Enter.
More info: On the async tree, the search is performed after you enter a search term.
Page 170
IPfolio User Guide
5. Select the required categories.
Result: By default, categorizations are saved as soon as you select/deselect them.
Category Tree Reports
The key to creating useful Category Tree reports is using the correct âReport Typeâ, and understanding
Categorizations.
Choosing the correct Report Type is key. For example, to report on patent categorizations, choose Patents with
Categorizations and Categories.
âª From the Reports tab, choose New Report.
âª Choose the Patents with Categorizations and Categories report type.
âª The two most important fields, PatentID and Category Name are added by default.
âª This report type gives you access to all fields from the Patent, Category, or Categorization objects.
âª These fields can be added to the report or used to filter the report.
Note:
In reports, you can identify the final node selected by you on the record's Category Tree and do the
corresponding filtering using a checkbox field Selected Category (available on all Categorization records -
IDF Categorization, Categorization, TM Categorization, Patent Family Categorization, Trademark Family
Categorization, etc.).
When set to "True", it indicates this is the last Category (or one of the same-level Categories) selected on the
record's Category Tree;"False"indicates there are nodes selected below.
Categories and Categorizations
Each check mark in a Category Tree is stored in a Categorizations table.
âª Categories are all the boxes you could check for a given patent.
âª Categorizations are the boxes you do check.
When using the Patents with Categorizations and Categories report type, each record is a check mark from the
Product tree.
Two Sides ofthe Same Coin
Patents with Categorizations and Categories records have patent (Patent ID) and Category (Category Name) data.
Therefore, you can use Patents with Categorizations and Categories to answer both questions:
âª Which patents are related to this product?
âª Which products are related to this patent?
Sort, group, and filter results from this report to get the answers you need.
Category Tree Configuration
To configure a category tree, you need to create the required category types, and corresponding categories.
Page 171
| 3 - Core Features
Creating Multiple Category Trees
You can use the Category Type âTree Indexâ to create multiple category trees on a single object.
You need the following:
âª Admin rights.
âª An object (on page 165) that supports category trees.
âª Async category tree.
Category Type records have a Tree Index field you can use to create multiple trees on the same object. The tree
index field on Category Type records essentially groups Category Type records.
Figure 8. Category type tree index field
1. Create category types as needed.
2. Create categories as needed and assign them to a category type.
3. Assign category types a Tree Index value. (You may need to adjust the Category Type layout to see the
Tree Index field.)
Configuring the Page Layout
4. Remove the existing Utils_CategoryTree category tree layout element, replacing it with one or more
CategoryTreeAsync elements.
5. Match the Tree Index on the CategoryTreeAsync component to the Tree Index of the correct Category
Type.
Set Tree Index for Category Type:
âª Category Type: Technology. Tree Index: 1
âª Category Type: Product. Tree Index: 2
Add two CategoryTreeAsync elements:
âª Configure one to display Tree Index â1â.
âª Configure the other to display Tree Index â2â.

Figure 10. Category Trees with Different Tree Index Values
Deactivating Categories
IPfolio users with admin rights have the possibility to deactivate individual Categories.
Deactivating a Category will disable the corresponding checkbox on the Categories tab of all records, so users will
no longer be able to select it in the future.
1. Go to Setup> Object Manager.
2. Select Categories.
3. Click on the Category Name of the Category to be disabled, in order to open its detail view.
4. Select the Inactive checkbox.
5. Click Save in the button bar. Your changes are saved.
The Category will now no longer be selectable on records' Categories tabs, and will only be visible to users with 
special permissions. If the change does not become active immediately, a page refresh might be necessary.
Page 173
| 3 - Core Features
Disabling Category Trees
If the Categories of a specific Category Tree should no longer be selectable by users, for example because a new
Category Tree (with different Categories/Category Types) has been created instead, it can be marked as read-only.
You need Admin rights, and an object (on page 165) that supports category trees.
This feature is available for both sync and async Category Trees.
1. Open the record type where you want to disable the Category Tree (e.g. a Patent record).
2. Select Edit Page and navigate to the Categories tab.
3. Select the Category Tree you want to disable.
4. Select the Read only checkbox in the tree settings to the right.
5. Save your changes to the page layout.
Figure 11. Category Tree with Active "Read only" Setting
The selected Category Tree is now read-only and its Category checkboxes will be disabled on all records of the same
type (e.g. all Patent records).
Any existing Categorizations that were selected before the Category Tree was disabled will remain unchanged.
Bulk Update Categories for Patents
The bulk update feature for categorizations in IPfolio is designed to simplify the process of managing patent 
categories across multiple records.
1. Add the Flow PAT - Advanced Category Operations to the page layout of the Categories tab in the Patent
object.
2. Select the category tree of a patent.
3. Select a bulk update option at the top of the category tree.
â¦ Copy categorizations from another patent
This option allows you to copy categories from one patent to the currently open patent.
You will be prompted to select a patent and to select the categories to be copied.
â¦ Propagate current categorizations to entire family
This option allows you to apply the current patentâs categories to all patents within the
same family. You will be prompted to select the categories to be copied to the patent
family.
â¦ Copy categorizations to another patent
Page 174
IPfolio User Guide
This option allows you to copy categories from the current patent to another patent. You
will be prompted to select a patent and to select the categories to be copied to another 
patent. Up to five patents can be selected.
â¦ Delete categorizations
Remove specific categories from multiple patents. Up to five patents can be selected.
4. After you have made your selection and added all necessary information, you will be asked to confirm the
changes.
Once confirmed, the selected categories will be updated across the specified patents.
AI-Driven Categorization for Patents
You can also benefit from AI-driven categorization for your patents.
To start using the functionality, first activate it on the Admin Panel by setting Use AI Taxonomies to true: Admin 
Panel > Integrations > IP One> Use AI Taxonomies.
Triggered by a manual or scheduled IP One Data sync, the system will then assign Patent records to the existing
Categories or, if necessary, create new ones.
Upon scheduled IP One Data syncs, AI Classifications will be automatically added and displayed on the Categories 
tab of all your Patent records.
If you would like to import AI categorization data for a particular Patent, you can do so by clicking IP ONE Sync on 
the record page and then refreshing it.
You can also remove AI Classifications from your Category Trees by clicking x next to them.
Documents
The Documents section is found throughout IPfolio.
Documents is built on an enterprise-grade Content Management System capable of handling hundreds of
thousands of documents of any type. You can create sub-folders, Drag and Drop to add documents, and even email
directly into the Documents folder of a specific record.
Page 175
| 3 - Core Features
Documents uses the Standard Salesforce File Uploader, which allows for larger file uploads (up to 2 GB), and
improved support for file selection, drag-and-drop, and different browsers.
Documents is fully integrated with our robust Search and Reporting capabilities. Use Global Search to find any
document, in any module, via keyword search (including text documents, MS Word documents, and even textsearchable pdf files).
Tip: If there are documents you find particularly important for a record type and therefore want to see
immediately upon opening the record, you can have them displayed in dedicated "File Views"(outside
the Documents section). For more information, please contact your System Administrator or the IPfolio
Support Team.

Document Preview
To preview a document on a Document Tree, just hover the cursor over the file name associated with a specific
document record, and the preview of its content will be automatically displayed in the preview pane.
You can also preview documents in the Documents Tab, which can be added manually. In the Documents tab you
can preview the whole document at once, if the file size is less than 15 MB. Should the document size exceed 15 MB,
only the first page of the document is visible.
The document preview is available for the files with the following
extensions: .docx, .pdf, .ppt, .pptx, .xls, .xlsx, .gif, .jpg, .png and.html (UTF-8). Please mind that it is NOT available for
.msg and .eml files, since email preview is only supported for emails received via IPfolio Email functionality, and
not for those uploaded from Outlook.

Displaying Related Attachments in the Document Tree
Attachments from Invention Disclosures can be automatically displayed in the document tree of a related Patent/
Patent Family.
The related attachments are displayed in a separate folder of the document tree. The documents are not copied/
cloned. This feature helps to avoid the duplication of documents and to preserve storage space and also works for
merged Invention Disclosure Forms.
1. Enable the Custom Setting Include Related Documents (Setup> Custom Settings> Config> Include 
Related Documents).
2. Optional: Add the Document Source column to the document tree view to indicate the origin of each 
document. (Please see Customizing Columns in the Document Tree (on page 179) for instructions.)
Attachments included in an Invention Disclosure are automatically organized and placed in a distinct folder in the
document tree of related Patents/Patent Families. Since the files in this folder are only references rather than
direct clones, you can only view and download the files in this folder. Manipulation of the files is only possible in the
originating Invention Disclosure record.
Warning:
Please bear in mind that if you have this functionality enabled and decide to disable it for some reason later on,
this deactivation will remove the IDF Attachments folder from all the Patent records. Thus, once the feature is
deactivated, the document tree on all Patents will look the same way it did before the Include Related Documents 
setting was originally enabled.
Creating a Task Linked to a Document
By right-clicking on a document in the Document Tree you can create a new Task via context menu.
After clicking on Create Task in the context menu, a new task creation process is triggered in a pop-up. In the
new window, the pre-populated fields are connected to the document from the Document Tree and the Patent or
trademark record.

Sending an Email (Lightning)
The recommended way of sending emails from a record is via the according Lightning Web Component.
âª Activate LWC Email Creation is selected.
âª Create Email Lightning Web Component is on the current page layout.
The Send Email from Record Lightning web component brings a number of usability improvements over the existing
Visualforce page.
âª The editor is embedded in the right panel. If needed, you can expand it into an overlay.
âª You can now add the record owner, inventors, or others related to the record.
âª The component uses the Standard Salesforce uploader which is easier to use and less restrictive.
1. Go to the Documents section of a record.
2. Click Create Email. The default editor opens in the panel to the right.
Page 185
| 3 - Core Features
3. You can also hide the fields Cc, Bcc and Template to get a simplified view of your Email. Simply click on the
Collapse Button in the Email template next to the formatting options.
4. Click the Expand Composer icon to expand the default editor into a more spacious overlay window, if
desired.
5. Enter one or more recipients.
More info: If one or more recipient addresses is/are incorrectly formatted, an error message will notify
you of this. Send is disabled until all addresses can be properly recognized.
6. Optionally, select a template and click Insert.
7. Compose the subject and body of the message.
8. Click the attachments icon to attach files, if needed. You can drag and drop files or select files from a
location. You can add multiple attachments.
The email message is sent, and a copy is saved in Documents on the current record.
Note: When you send an email using the Reply or Reply All actions, the attachments are not included in the
message. When the Forward action is used, attachments are included in the email.
Tip: You can have the Email window that opens when clicking Create Email maximized by default using the
Use Expanded Size Email Window configuration setting (on page 196).

Draft.
Page 188
IPfolio User Guide
Your draft and attachments to the email (if you added any) are then automatically displayed in the document tree of
the record. Attachments are shown below the draft.
Figure 17. Email Draft in Document Tree incl. Attachment
Attachments within drafts can be moved around in the document tree separately from the draft. When doing this,
the content is copied over to the new location rather than just moved.
You can also attach uploaded files from the record to the draft. These are also saved automatically.
Note: The Document Date field on Email drafts stays blank upon the Email draft creation/updates and gets
populated only once the Email is actually sent.
Sending Emails to a Record
It is possible to send emails directly to one or more specific records in the system.
Org requirements:
âª An org email address.
âª A custom object configured to receive email.
Email requirements:
âª A message with a well-formed subject line that refers to a specific record or a Law Firm.
âª A message body of up to 130,000 characters long.
âª Attachments of any kind up to 25 MB.
âª A maximum of 200 different records can be addressed at once.
Collaborating on records in the system is best when possible. For users who donât have access to the system, or
for customers who simply prefer email, sending email to records in the system is a helpful alternative. Customers
sometimes âcopy the systemâ on important emails and ask outside counsel to do the same.
Org Email Address: During setup we create a unique email address for your org. Use this âOrg Email Addressâ to
send email to your org.
Subject line: When email is sent to the org, the system parses the subject line, looking for the record to save the
message to. For this to work, the subject line of the incoming message must be âwell-formedâ. A well-formed subject
line has the subject text and a record name, separated by //. You can also send emails to all objects that have a Law
Firm Reference field by indicating the Law Firm reference number in the subject after the subject text and //.
To send an email to a record, send (or copy) an email with a well-formed subject line to the org email address:
1. Add recipients normally.
2. Add the org email address in the cc: field.
3. Add // <record name> or // <law firm reference number> to the end of the subject line.
Page 189
| 3 - Core Features
4. Optional: Use the delimiter , if you want to send the message to multiple records or Law Firms at once.
See also this example (on page 190).
5. Compose the message normally.
6. Add attachments as needed.
The message and attachments are saved in the Documents section of the specified record.
Ask recipients to âReply Allâ when responding to your message to capture your message and all responses in the
system.
Send Email to Record Examples
Use two forward slashes (//) followed by record number when sending an email to an IPfolio record.
Single Record in Subject
From: oc@firm.com
 To: ihc@company.com
 Cc: customer@ipfolio.cc
 Subject: Filed App // P123-US (1)(2)
 Body:
 This app is now filed.
1 Record name separated by â//â
2 You could use â--â instead but some email programs convert this to a single dash which doesnât
work.
Multiple Records in Subject
From: oc@firm.com
 To: ihc@company.com
 Cc: customer@ipfolio.cc
 Subject: Filed Apps // P123-US, P456-US, P789-US (1)
 Body:

 To: ihc@company.com
 Cc: customer@ipfolio.cc
 Subject: Filed App
 Body:
 P123-US (1)
 This app is now filed.
1 Record name in the first line of the message body.
Content Sharing
In IPfolio, the default Content Sharing Model is 'Library', which determines how the email body and attachments are
rendered.
In IPfolio, the default Content Sharing Model is Library (Setup > Custom Code > Custom Metadata Types > Content
Sharing Configuration > Sharing Model), which means that for the Email body and attachments to be created and
Page 190
IPfolio User Guide
rendered on a record properly, the Email sender (Attachment Owner) should be the user who is a member of the IP 
Right Attachments Library.
Since not all users can be Library members (Portal Submitters - e.g., TSR Record Owners), for the functionality to
work properly, currently the Attachment Owner is always set to the Admin User. However, should you still have
issues with the correct preview/rendering of the inbound Emails and their attachments on a record, please contact
your System Administrator or the IPfolio Premium Services Team.
Forwarding Emails in the Documents Section
You can easily forward received Emails from the Document tree.
1. Right click on the Email you want to forward, and then click Forward in the context menu.
2. Enter Email recipients and your message. Change the case ID in the Subject Line if needed.

formatting of the Email body (further sent Email) might differ from that defined in the HTML Email 
template.
To prevent some of the formatting issues, please refer here: Lightning Web Component: Input
Rich Text.
Also, to ensure consistent spacing between what is presented in the LWC and what is defined in
the HTML Email Template, we recommend that you use the <br/> tag instead of <p>.
6. Optional: Enter the text-only version of your email for recipients who cannot read HTML.
7. Click Save.
Note: You can also create an email template that includes an attachment. When you later navigate to
the specific objectâs Documents section and click the Create Email button to use that previously created

Organization-Wide Email Addresses
Automatic Assignment of Email Ownership
Emails are assigned ownership according to whether it is an outgoing email or inbound email.
The ownership of an Email is automatically assigned based on the following scenarios:
Outgoing Emails The sender of the Email is assigned as the Email owner.
Inbound Response Emails For responses to Emails initially sent out by IPfolio, the assigned Email
owner is the sender of the initial Email.
Unassociated Inbound Emails
If a received Email is not a direct response to an Email initially sent out 
by IPfolio (i.e. an unrelated Email), the owner of the relevant case is assigned as the Email owner.
The ownership is visible in
âª The Document Tree - column "Created By"
âª The File Details ofthe Document Tree (right-click on an Email and select File Details) - field "Owner"
âª The Document Tab - field "Owner"/"Owner ID"
Creating an Email Recipient Suggestion List
You can include Email addresses from lookup fields in the Email recipient suggestion list on such core objects as
Invention Disclosure, Patent, Patent Family, Trademark Search Request, Trademark, Trademark Family, IP Contract,
Conflict, General Matter.
Page 197
| 3 - Core Features
1. If the necessary lookup field to a Party, a User, or a Contact doesn't exist on the object yet, create it
first: Navigate to one of the core objects in the Object Manager (Setup> Object Manager> Quick Find 
the required object- e.g., Patent- and click to open > Fields & Relationships> New) and follow the 
instructions.
2. Once you have all the necessary lookup fields available, add them to the Email Recipient Suggestion List 
field set by drag-and-dropping:
Whenever you start typing in the To, Cc, Bcc fields of a new Email, the Email recipients suggestion list will include 
Email addresses from the lookup fields that belong to the Email Recipient Suggestion List field set.
Note: For Party lookups, the values of the Email1, Email2 and Email3 fields will be listed as suggestions (if 
available); for User and Contact lookups â the value of the Email field.
Include Additional Email Recipient Suggestions for Law Firms
You need to add these fields manually to the Law Firm record.
Populate fields Email2 and Email3 to have these options available when creating an Email. Make sure that Activate 
LWC Email Creation is enabled on the Email Settings tab of the Admin Panel.
Whenever you subsequently create a new Email to a Law Firm, Email2 and Email3 are also visible in addition to 
Email1.
External Links
IPfolio generates links to external records that correspond to your IPfolio records. This is a convenience feature
designed to make it easy for you to get to public records.
IPfolio uses values from the current record to create the URL. The link works if: relevant fields on the current record
are correct (the field value is correct and properly formatted.) and the public record exists and is in the expected
location.
Note: Our links use values from the current record to create a well-formed URL.
Page 198
IPfolio User Guide
Figure 19. Patent record showing external links
Consider the value US20190330097 in Link to Google Patents above. To get this value:
âª Use the base url for the Google Patents: âhttps://patents.google.com/patentâ
âª Append the Country of the current record: âUSâ
âª Append the Patent Number (if available) or the Publication Number: â20190330097â
âª The result is: âhttps://patents.google.com/patent/â + âUSâ + â20190330097â
This link works.
âª The record values are correct and properly formatted.
âª The external record exists.
Other links may not.
âª The record values may be incorrect or improperly formatted.
âª The external record may not exist or have other issues.
This a simplified example. Our link formulas are quite sophisticated, correcting input errors when possible (like deduping Country when itâs included with the Publication Number), and not displaying links for illogical combinations.
Unfortunately, we canât account for all issues with IPfolio records and external data sets.
Note: The Links component only shows if valid links exist.
Links for Export
The Link to PTO, Link to PTO 2, and Link to Google Patents links work when clicked from within IPfolio. Due to
minor formatting differences, these links donât work when exported, then opened in Excel.
We have âexportâ versions of each:
âª Link to Google Patents (for Export)
âª Link to PTO (for Export)
âª Link to PTO 2 (for Export)
To use:
Page 199
| 3 - Core Features
âª Create a report in IPfolio.
âª Select the âexportâ version of the Link
âª Save your report as âComma-delimited .csvâ.
Excel recognizes the field as a hyperlink formula when you open it.
Troubleshooting External Links
To troubleshoot links:
âª Make sure the IPfolio field values are correct (and correctly formatted.)
âª Visit the public data source directly to see if the record exists.
âª If the public record exists, compare the URLs.
âª If the public record doesnât exist, check whether other records of the same type exist in the public data.
Issues with public data record sets include:
âª The public data set doesnât include the type of record you are looking for. (Limited data.)
âª The public data set should include the record you are looking for but doesnât. (Incomplete data.)
âª The record exists but has inaccurate or malformed data. (Incorrect data.)
Family Tree
The Family Tree is a simple but insightful visual representation of a familyâs members. The Family Tree is available on
the Patent, Patent Family, Trademark, Trademark Family, and Domain Name Family objects.
The Family Tree shows the Name, Country, and Status of each family member and the family hierarchy.
The Family Tree features a modern Lightning design that lets you:
âª Expand and collapse nodes.
âª Hover over records for additional details.
âª Go to a record by clicking the record.
Figure 20. Family tree
Patents
The Family Tree shows members of the immediate family, and members of families that share a common parent.
Page 200
IPfolio User Guide
IPfolio uses the Patent Family and ParentID fields to build the tree.
âª All records with the same Patent Family field value are said to be in the âimmediate familyâ and therefore show 
in the tree.
âª IPfolio uses the ParentID of each record to determine the tree hierarchy.
We also use ParentID to find all related parent and child records. (We perform a recursive search, looking âupâ to
find related parent records, and âdownâ to find related child records.) If we find a record in a different family that has
a parent in the current family, that family is also included in the tree since these families âshare a common parentâ.
Note: âCommon parentâ families can be very large and may be difficult to show in the Family Tree. If
necessary, use the Family Tree: Max Outside Members custom setting to limit the number of outside
records displayed in the Family Tree.
Complex Families
Unusually complex families (e.g., the ones involving multiple unrelated parent records) can sometimes cause
incorrect/incomplete rendering of the Family Tree.
In such cases, a relevant error message will be shown and the family structure might need to be revised.
Generally, the Family Graph might be preferable to the Family Tree in case of complex families. The Family Graph
is a separate tool expressly designed to model more complex families. Due to the complex nature of the families it
models, the Family Graph sometimes shows more records than the Family Tree.
If desired, graph items can be manually rearranged. However, we recommend deactivating the "Graph Physics"
checkbox before doing so.
Please bear in mind that only family members can be shown on the Family Graph, so in cases where, e.g., a parent
record is outside of the family the graph is built for, you will get the following error message:"The Family Graph may
be incomplete because one or more of its records donât belong to the same family."
Display Options
âª Nodes with more than 10 direct children are collapsed by default.
âª The status color of the node is derived from the underlying record.
âª Family members at the same level of the tree are sorted by Filing Date, then Country, then record Name.
Tip: Sorting by Country can be helpful, especially for trademarks. While you canât change the Family Tree
sort order, you can create a related list in the Trademark Family (or Patent Family) object and sort it by
Country. This way, records are sorted by Filing Date in the Family Tree and sorted by Country in the related 
list.

Setting the Record Image
You can use one of the images in the Documents tree as the image for the record.
1. Open the required record.
2. In the Documents tree, right-click on the required image file, and then select Use as Record Image.
More info: 
To be properly displayed and not get distorted,
âª If the image is smaller than the viewport, it will keep its original size.
âª If the image is bigger than the viewport, it will be resized to fit the viewport.
Adding the Image Component to a Page
Administrators can add the image component to the page layout.
Page 202

1. Select Setup> Edit Page
2. Add the Image for Display component to the page layout.
3. Add the Preview image field to the record layout.
Image Propagation
For patents and trademarks, IPfolio copies the record image from parent to child records during child record creation. 
The record image doesnât propagate when added to the parent after child record creation.
Parentto Child
Note: See Patent Family to Patent (on page 203) for a way to propagate a record image after child record
creation.
We use a âfield setâ to copy image-related fields from the parent to the child during child record creation. For this to
work, the following fields must be in the âCopy when creating child recordsâ field set on patents and trademarks:
âª Image Attachment Id
âª Image External Path
âª Image Height
âª Image Status
âª Image Width
Patent Family to Patent
When you add a record image to a patent family record, the image is copied to all patents in the family. You can
remove and re-add the record image on the patent family record to update the record image on all family members 
at any time.
Espacenet Images
On patents, if you donât set a record image, IPfolio will display an image from Espacenet when possible.
IPfolio looks for a matching Espacenet record using the current Country Code and Publication Number (or Patent
Number). If we find a matching record with a suitable image, we display it.
Page 203
| 3 - Core Features
Important: We find and display the image in real time when you open the record. We donât save the image.
Limitations
Espacenet images have inherent limitations.
âª Our ability to display an Espacenet image is subject to the limitations of this public data source.
âª Because there is no local file, there is nothing to copy to child records. (If a child record has an image, it is likely
because IPfolio found an Espacenet image for that record separately.)
We display Espacenet images when possible but donât guarantee their availability.
Tip: Use local images whenever possible.
Troubleshooting
To determine which records use a local file and which use a dynamic image from Espacenet, create a report that
includes the Image Attachment Id and Image Status fields. Records with values in Image Attachment Id and Image 
Status use a local file.
To troubleshoot missing Espacenet record images, check Espacenet.
âª Does the record exist?
âª Is there a suitable image?
We use the following logic to retrieve the Espacenet image. In this example, we pull the Espacenet image for
âEP1165867â. Replace âEPâ (Country Code) and â1165867â (Publication Number or Patent Number) with other 
values to check other records:

Creating an Invention Disclosure
Inventors use the IP Portal to submit ideas to the IP team.
You should be a company employee with IP Portal access.
Page 205
| 4 - IP Portal
The Invention Disclosure form on the IP Portal guides inventors through the process of describing and submitting
an idea.
1. Log in to the portal.
2. Select New Invention Disclosure.
3. Complete the interactive disclosure form. Features vary from portal to portal, but will normally include the
following fields.
Option Description
Title Enter a title for the invention disclosure.
Invention Description Enter details of invention.
Problem solved Enter a description of how your invention addresses a technical problem.
Date of Conception Enter the date the invention was conceived.
Co-Inventors
You can use the Inventors âtype-aheadâ field to name co-inventors. To enter an
employee co-inventor, type a few letters of a name (or Employee ID), and then
select the correct name from the list of available matches.
The names displayed are company employees stored in IPfolio Contacts. They
typically come from your HR group and should be kept current. See Inventors 
(on page 237) for more information about inventors, and Import Contacts (on
page 540) for details on importing contacts.
To enter a non-employee co-inventor, enter a valid email address for the nonemployee inventor, and then enter a First and Last Name when prompted.
The submitter can indicate a âShare of Inventionâ to inventors. (Optional.)
Attachments Inventors can attach drawings, sketches, or documents of any type that aid in
the understanding of the invention. Inventors use drag and drop to add attachments. (Some portals have a 25MB per document size limit on attachments.)
4. Click Submitfor Review.
More info: Click Save for Later to save a submission without submitting it. The status is set to âDraftâ
indicating the submission is not yet complete. You can then click My Inventions to re-open and edit the 
submission later.
CAUTION: The portal automatically saves some data as you work. However, we donât guarantee
that all data is saved. To avoid losing work, please use Save for Later or Submitfor Review when 
you are finished editing.
When the inventor clicks Submitfor Review, the system:
âª Sets the Status of the invention disclosure to âSubmitted for Reviewâ.
âª Locks the record, preventing further edits by inventors.
âª Changes the record owner to a member of IP team.
âª Sets the In-House Counsel field using custom logic.
âª Notifies the IP team of the submission.
âª Sends a confirmation email to the inventor and co-inventors.
Page 206
IPfolio User Guide
The specifics vary considerably from customer to customer. (For example, who gets notified, and how In-House
Counsel is determined.) Regardless, the goal is to save the submission, notify interested parties, and ensure the right
people can see and edit the record.
Editing Existing Invention Disclosures
Inventors have read access to all of their invention disclosures on the portal, and write access to some of their 
invention disclosures.
Current users who are submitters or co-inventors can edit invention disclosures according to the invention
disclosure status.
In addition to keeping inventors apprised of progress, Status determines whether the disclosure is editable. By
default, only disclosures with a status of âDraftâ and âFurther Info Neededâ are editable.
1. Log in to the portal.
2. Select My invention Disclosures in Draft or My Invention Disclosures Requiring Further Information.
Invention Disclosure Edit Settings
Administrators can change the statuses of invention disclosures which allow inventors to edit them, and define if coinventors can edit disclosures.
Status Modification
You can override the default by entering a list of editable statuses in Editable IDF Statuses (in the Admin Panel on
the Portal Settings tab).
Example: Override Editable Statuses Enter "Draft, Submitted for Review, Further Info Needed"in Editable IDF 
Statuses to make these statuses âeditableâ.
Co-inventors
Use Allow Co-Inventor Edits of IDFs (in the Admin Panel on the Portal Settings tab) to control whether co-inventors
can edit disclosures.
âª If selected, co-inventors have the same write access as submitters.
âª If deselected, co-inventors canât edit disclosures.
View Rules for Invention Disclosures
When a portal user selects My Invention Disclosures, they see a list of invention disclosures that includes invention
disclosures they submitted and those for which they are named as a co-inventor.
The Inventor (IDF) object has a record for all inventors on all invention disclosures. Each IDF Inventor (on page
237) record includes a link to the inventorâs contact record and to the related invention disclosure.
For the current portal user, IPfolio uses:
âª Information from their User account to find their contact record.
âª The user's contact record to find their Inventor (IDF) records.
âª Inventor (IDF) records to generate the list of invention disclosures.
Page 207
| 4 - IP Portal
By default, IPfolio matches records using the current userâs email address. If Use EmployeeID for matching is 
selected, we match records using their Employee ID.
Note: See Record Matching (on page 525) for additional details.
View Rules for Patents on the IP Portal
When a portal user selects âMy Patentsâ they see a list of patents on which they are a submitter or co-inventor.
The Inventor object has a record for all inventors on all patents. Each Inventor (on page 237) record includes a link 
to the inventorâs party record and to the related patent.
For the current portal user, IPfolio uses:
âª Information from their User account to find their party record.
âª Their party record to find their Inventor records.
âª The Inventor records to generate the list of patents.
By default, IPfolio matches records using the current userâs email address. If Use EmployeeID for matching is 
selected, we match records using their Employee ID.
Note: See Record Matching (on page 525) for additional details.
Edit Rules for Patents on the IP Portal
You can let inventors edit patent records directly from the IP Portal.
By default, all Inventors (on page 237) have read access to patents listed on the portal. However, you can override
the default behavior by selecting Allow Edits by Inventors on the patent record.
Allow Edits by Inventors is deselected by default so inventors canât edit the patent.
You can use business logic to automatically select/deselect Allow Edits by Inventors so that, for example, inventors
can provide feedback on the record for an Allowance Review or similar process.
IP Portal Document Tree
The document tree is available within the IP Portal.
If Visible on Portal (on page 175) is enabled, folders with at least one attachment are displayed in the document tree
of the IP Portal.
It is not possible to create new folders in the document tree in the IP Portal. The remaining functionalities of the
document tree are unaffected.
Page 208
Chapter 5. Patent Lifecycle
With IPfolio you can create, manage and track your patents from idea submission throughout their entire lifecycle.
Invention Disclosures
An invention disclosure is a confidential document describing your invention, explaining why it is important and how
it is different from other prior art. Invention disclosures are the first step of the patenting process.
The stages involved in the invention disclosure process are typically as follows:
1. The inventor submits an invention disclosure on the portal.
2. The IP team performs an initial review, checking the submission for completeness.
3. The team requests information from the inventor.
4. The team assesses the invention novelty by adding prior art to the invention disclosure/requesting
patentability search from Clarivate or an outside counsel. Files added to an Invention Disclosure are
automatically visible in the Document Tree of its related Patent.
5. A patent committee reviews the submission.
6. The team makes a final filing decision.
Invention Disclosure Status
The Status field on the invention disclosure record reflects the stage of the invention disclosure process.
IPfolio updates the Status field automatically. For example, when an inventor submits a disclosure, IPfolio updates
Status to Submitted for Review.

Novelty Analysis/Patentability Search
Before sending the invention disclosure for Patent Committee review, you can assess its novelty and (if a similar
idea already exists) associate this invention disclosure with the already existing patent; or add prior art to it - either
yourself, or/and ask for patentability search from Clarivate or an Outside Counsel.
Associating a New Invention Disclosure with the Existing Patent
When a Patent is created from an Invention Disclosure, the records are linked via the Invention Disclosure field on 
the Patent. If an Invention Disclosure/Patent combination exists, and a similar idea is submitted later, the IP team
can associate the new Invention Disclosure with the existing Patent, using the Merged into Patent feature.
Merged into Patentis a lookup field on the Invention Disclosure record. Thus, if there exists an Invention
Disclosure/Patent combination, you just need to add the Patent ID to the Merged into Patent field on subsequent 
Invention Disclosures, which will also add those Invention Disclosures to the Merged IDFs related list on the Patent.
This assumes the primary Invention Disclosure/Patent relationship has already been established, and you are
associating other Invention Disclosures with the Patent.
For example:
Page 212
IPfolio User Guide
âª In January, a Patent record is created from an Invention Disclosure (IDF-001 > P-001).
âª In February, an inventor submits a very similar idea (IDF-002).
âª To associate the new Invention Disclosure with the existing Patent, go to the IDF and enter the Patent ID in the
Merged into Patent field. In this case, add P-001 into the Merged into Patent field on IDF-002.
âª This adds IDF-002 to the Merged IDFs related list on the P-001 Patent record.
Attention: You are not merging two Invention Disclosures together. You are associating additional Invention
Disclosures with an existing Patent.
Adding Prior Art to Your Invention Disclosure
If you have Innography license, you can conduct an integrated Invention Screening for your Invention Disclosure to
sift out inventions that are not novel. You can also cite patent references, as well as add existing and new non-patent
literature directly from the invention disclosure.
Invention Screening
IPfolio users also having access to Innography have the possibility to conduct an integrated Invention Screening for
every new Invention Disclosure, so they can easily filter out inventions that are clearly not novel.
The following invention disclosure fields are used as a joint basis for the semantic publication/prior art search in
Innography:
âª Title
âª Short Description
âª Problem Solved
âª Novel Features
âª Advantages
âª Disadvantages
Note: All publication/prior art searches are conducted in English. If the content of a field is in a different 
language, it will be auto-translated to English. The translation is performed by the Microsoft translation
service. The text is sent to the service anonymously over an encrypted connection with no user-identifying
information. The jurisdictions considered in the search are US, JP, CN, KR, WO, EP and DE.
Conducting an Invention Screening
You can conduct an integrated Invention Screening for every new Invention Disclosure.
1. Open the Invention Disclosure record.
2. Go to the Invention Screening tab. A new search will be conducted upon selecting the tab, and the results 
table will be loaded.
Page 213
| 5 - Patent Lifecycle
You can now review the results and create Publication records for all the results you consider relevant for the
invention.
Creating Publications/Cited References from Invention Screening Results
You can create linked Publication records from one or more Invention Screening results.
1. Activate the checkboxes of all results you want to create linked Publication records
for.
2. Click Create Cited Prior Art (IDF) above the results table.
Page 214
IPfolio User Guide
IPfolio will create new Publication records for all selected entries for which no record exists yet. It will also
download the related documents as "Main Publication Copies", and will list the records as "Cited References" on the
Relations tab of the Invention Disclosure.
Configuring the Semantic Search
The fields included in the semantic search can be configured by using a specific field set.
The semantic search functionality in the Invention Screening allows users to screen submitted invention disclosures
for existing prior art. The field set configuration enhances the flexibility and adaptability of the screening process by
allowing users to customize which fields are included in the semantic search.
1. Got to Setup> Object Manager> Invention Disclosure > Field Sets> Invention Screening Fields.
Result: This field set will be used to designate which fields should be included in the Innography semantic
search.
2. Include necessary fields in the field set. By default, the following fields are included: Title, Short 
Description, Problem Solved, Novel Features, Advantages, Disadvantages.
3. Once the necessary fields are included, save the field set to apply the configuration.
Citing Patent References from an Invention Disclosure
You can cite patent references directly from an invention disclosure record by entering the patent or publication
numbers. If the patent reference does not currently exist in the publication library, it will be added.
1. Open the required invention disclosure record.
2. Click the Relations tab.
3. In Cited References click Cite Patent Art.
4. Enter the patent or publication numbers without spaces, with each number on a new line. Numbers can be 
entered with or without Kind Code (see the tooltip next to âAdd Multiple Patent Prior Artâ for examples).
Mind, however, that the outcome will be slightly different.
More info: 
If your enter a publication number WITH a Kind Code, the meta data and document returned will reflect 
the given Kind Code version. If there is no match in IP ONE Data, the Publication record will be created
without retrieving any meta data or documents.
Page 215
| 5 - Patent Lifecycle
If you enter a publication number WITHOUT a Kind Code, the Publication will be created with the latest 
version of the Patent/Publication in IP ONE Data (and appending the Kind Code to the Publication ID).
If there is no match in IP ONE Data, the Publication record will be created without the Kind Code and 
without retrieving any meta data or documents.
5. Click Save.
Adding Existing Non-Patent Literature from an Invention Disclosure
You can search for existing non-patent literature from an invention disclosure record, and add it to the current case.
1. Open the required invention disclosure record.

Patents
After the filing decision has been made, the patenting process is ready to move on, with several consequent stages
involved.
Typically, the steps are as follows:
Page 220
IPfolio User Guide
1. The IP team creates the first patent filing from an invention disclosure (OR from a patent family, OR using
the Filing Strategy functionality).
2. The IP team sends Outside Counsel instructions from a newly created patent record.
3. The firm drafts the application and adds the Application Number to the record.
âª IPsync matches eligible IPfolio records with records from eligible jurisdictions, reconciling data in key
fields.
âª IPsync triggers auto-docketing via DocketEngine (or our Docketing Light solution).
4. The IP team creates subsequent filings from the (parent) patent record.
Note: IPfolio automatically updates the patent status using key dates.

Patent Status
The Status field on the Patent record reflects the stage of the patenting process.
Patent records have two status fields: Status (High-Level) and Status (Prosecution).
Table: Patent Status Fields
Status Description
Status 
(High-Level)
Tracks patents in simple, broad terms.
Status 
(Prosecution)
Tracks patents in greater detail. Analogous to âstatus with the patent officeâ.
You can control and customize the logic of setting Status (Prosecution) on Patent records. For details please see Customizing Status (Prosecution) Logic on Patents (on page 222).

âª Patent Family field selects an existing family where the patent should 
be created. If the field is left blank, a new family will be created.
âª The system populates PatentID. Adjust as needed.
Instructions âª Use Instructions to set Law Firm, Firm Attorney, and target dates.
âª The defaults for First Draft By Date and Target Filing Date are customizable.
4. Click Create Patent Record.
âª Creates a new patent record with a status of Approved for Filing.
âª Creates a new patent family record.
âª Links the invention disclosure, patent family, and patent records.

| 5 - Patent Lifecycle
Patent Families
In IPfolio, a Patent Family groups patent records together and stores information about the family.
You can create a patent family manually, but most are created in the background during the process of creating a
first patent filing from the invention disclosure.
A Patent Family is a collection of patents, each with its own status. The logic used to assign a status to the family is
open to interpretation. IPfolio sets Family Status as follows:
â¢ If at least one family member is In Force, the family is In Force
â¢ If at least one member is Pending, the family is Pending
â¢ If at least one member is Expiring, the family is Expiring
â¢ If all family members are Not Filed, the family is Not Filed
â¢ If all members are Not Filed or Finally Lapsed, the family is Finally Lapsed
â¢ If all members are Not Filed or Lapsed or Finally Lapsed, the family is Lapsed
â¢ If all members are Not Filed or Closed, the family is Closed
â¢ If all members are Not Filed or Sold, the family is Sold
â¢ Else the family is Closed

Creating a First Patent Filing with Filing Strategy
You can also create the first patent filing using the Filing Strategy functionality.
In order to make initial use of this feature, you first need to set up the corresponding objects and configure them to
your needs. Three objects related to Filing Strategies are
âª Filing Strategy
âª Filing Strategy Phase
âª Filing Strategy Country
For detailed information on setting up, selecting, applying and executing Filing Strategies see Filing Strategy (on page

In addition to that:
âª Status (Prosecution) is set to Approved for Filing.
âª Date Sent to Firm is set to today.
âª First Draft By is set to 30 days from today, and Target Filing Date - to 60 days from today.
Submitting Draft Applications (by Law Firm Users)
Giving an Outside Counsel access to IPfolio makes collaborating directly on patent records possible. The specific
tasks an Outside Counsel performs in IPfolio vary from customer to customer. At this stage, itâs common for an
Outside Counsel to submit draft applications and update key fields on assigned records.
Submitting Draft Applications
The Send Out email to an Outside Counsel includes a link to the newly created patent record in IPfolio. Law Firm
users can click the link to access the record, or login to IPfolio directly to see all applications assigned to them.
The Documents section on Patents makes it easy for an Outside Counsel to submit drafts and other supporting
materials directly on the record.
Entering Application Number
IPsync helps automate docket data entry by comparing IPfolio records with records from the USPTO and other
jurisdictions. We use the Application Number to match the IPfolio record with the external record. If you are using
IPsync, an Outside Counsel should enter the Application Number promptly.

Creating Subsequent Patent Filings
Subsequent patent filings are created from the existing parent patent record. You can also use the Filing Strategy
functionality for this purpose.
Creating Subsequent Patent Filings from a Parent Record
In IPfolio, you can create one or more subsequent filings from the existing parent record.
1. Open the required patent record.
2. Click Create Child Records.
3. Select the countries where you want to create a child
record.
4. Click Create Child Records.
Subsequent Filing Customizations
IPfolio field sets let you customize the child record creation process.
âª Use the Child Record Creation Additional Fields field set to adjust the fields displayed on the Create Child 
Records page layout.
âª Use the Copy when creating child records field set to specify additional fields to copy from parent to child
during child record creation.
âª Use the Copy when creating SPC or PTE child records field set to specify additional fields to copy from
parent to child during child record creation, when Relationship to Parent on the child record is Supplementary 
Protection Certificate or Patent Term Extension.
âª Use the Skip copy same name fields field set to define the fields to be skipped during the automatic copying of
field values from one object to another. The values of the fields specified in this field set will not copy over when
creating a Patent from a Patent Family.
Parent Patents
In IPfolio, Patents can have no parent (for example, a provisional application), a single parent, or multiple parents.
Page 228
IPfolio User Guide
Populating the ParentID and Relationship to Parent fields during child record creation is sufficient for a single 
parent.
To add multiple parents, go to the Family tab of the child record and add them to the Parent Patents related list.
Please note that you can only create a parent patent for a patent that has a family assigned to it.
Note: Parent Patent records have a Relationship to Parent picklist field that can include a Terminal 
Disclaimer option. Contact us if you would like us to add this value.

Creating Subsequent Patent Filings with Filing Strategy
You can also create subsequent patent filings using the Filing Strategy functionality.
For detailed information on setting up, selecting, applying and executing Filing Strategies see Filing Strategy (on page
243).
Automated Due Date Calculation for Patents
IPfolio calculates an estimated Maximum Term for patents.
The simplified rules for these calculations are as follows:
âª 12 months from Filing Date for US Provisional Applications
âª 31 months from Earliest Priority Date for PCT Applications
âª 3 months from Issue Date for European Patent Applications
âª 20 years from Filing Date for all other Patents
âª 10 years from Filing Date for Utility Models
âª Divisionals (except EP), Reissues, and US Continuations and CIPs: inherit Maximum Term from Parent IP Right
Note:
We donât update Maximum Term directly. Instead, we create a Data Audit with the proposed value.
There are exceptions. We update Maximum Term directly when:
âª Maximum Term is empty.
âª Maximum Term= Standard Expiration Date.
âª The application is changed to a Provisional.
IPfolio also populates the new Patent record with data from the Invention Disclosure.
IPfolio:
Page 229
| 5 - Patent Lifecycle
âª Copies key fields like Title and In-House Counsel.
âª Creates new patent inventors based on existing IDF inventors.
âª Copies Documents from the disclosure to Documents on the patent (into the âIDF Attachmentsâ folder).

Third Party Patents
For managing third party patents, a separate Third Party Patent object is available.
This object allows you to manage Third Party bibliographical data, attach documents, manage tasks, and relate those
records to Conflicts, Contracts, and more.
1. Open the Third Party Patents tab.
2. Click New to create a new record.
3. Click Save.

Data Propagation
When creating patent child records, certain fields are copied from parent patents to the newly-created children.
Related information
Data Audit (on page 640)
EP National Phase Children
When you create a National Phase child record from an EP parent, we copy the following fields from the parent to
the child.
âª Filing Date
âª Application Number
âª Publication Date
âª Publication Number
âª Issue Date
âª Patent Number
If you edit these fields on an existing â¦â
Page 230
IPfolio User Guide
âª EP parent â the parent values are pushed to all existing National Phase children. If a field on the child is empty,
the parent value is copied. If a field on the child has a different value, a Data Audit is created. Values are copied
to the child records regardless of the child country.
âª National Phase child â the child record values are compared against the parent ones. If a field on the child has a 
different value, a Data Audit is created.
UP Children
For proper data propagation, the UP case should be created as a child of an EP case. This ensures that all fields and
links function as intended.
WO Children
The following fields are propagated from a WO parent to its children:
âª PCT Filing Date
âª PCT Application Number
âª PCT Receiving Office
âª PCT Search Authority
There are exceptions. The fields are not propagated when:
âª The child is a WO.
âª The child Relationship to Parent is Claims Priority.
Note: For International Design Designations (Type of Right is Design and the child Relationship to Parent is 
International Design), the Filing Date and Application Number values of the WO parent are inherited and 
copied over into the same-name fields of the children records.
PCT Application Number Propagation Example
P12345-WO (Ancestor)
âª Country: WO
âª Filing Date: 1/1/2020
âª Application Number: PCT/2020/US12345

SPC (Supplementary Protection Certificate)/ PTE (Patent Term Extension) Cases
When Relationship to Parent on the child record is Supplementary Protection Certificate or Patent Term 
Extension, the fields copied from parent to child patents upon child record creation are as follows:
âª Filing Date
âª Earliest Priority Date
âª Earliest Priority Number
Children Whose Relationship to Parent Is 'Confirmation of a Foreign Registration'
For the child patents whose Relationship to Parent is Confirmation of a Foreign Registration and Type of Right is 
Patent, Design or Utility Model, the following field values are inherited from the parent patent to the child ones:
âª Filing Date
âª Earliest Priority Date
âª Earliest Priority Number
Assignments
Patents can be owned, assigned, and licensed to others. To track assignments, use the Assignment History tab on 
patents.
Included Data
There are certain fields on the assignee and patent records that are essential for the assignment process.
Assignee records include:
âª A Patent field linking the assignee record to the parent patent.
âª A Party field linking the assignee record to a related party.
âª Assignment Date, Assigned From, Ownership Type, Reel Number, and Frame Number fields to track
assignment details.
Assignee records also include Country, Application Number, and Filing Date fields that are populated by IPfolio
with data derived from the related patent.
Patent records include:
âª All Assignees, a comma-separated list of current assignees from the Assignment History related list.
âª First-Named Assignees, the first current assignee from the Assignment History related list (based on the display
order).
Note:
Current Assignees
If the Ownership Type of an Assignee record is Current Assignee, Current Licensee with Full Rights, or if 
Ownership Type is empty, the assignee is considered a âcurrent assigneeâ.
Page 232
IPfolio User Guide
IPfolio assignee records include two fields that indicate whether the assignee is a âcurrent assigneeâ:
âª Current.
âª Hide in Narrow List.
When Current is true, Hide in Narrow List is false, and vice-versa. You can use either field in layouts, views,
and reports.
How It Works
You can create and reorder assignments related to your patent. Current assignments are also copied from parent to
child records.
Creating Assignments
You can created assignments using the Assignment History tab on a patent record.
1. Open the Assignment History tab on the patent record.
2. Click New in the Assignment History related list.
3. Select the assignee by filling in the Party field and enter assignment details..
4. Click Save.
Reordering Assignments
You can reorder assignments using the Reorder Assignees related list on a patent record.
Assignment records have a Display Order field used to order assignment records. The display order affects some
features (e.g. reporting).
Page 233
| 5 - Patent Lifecycle
Use the Reorder Assignment component (located below the Assignment History related list) to reorder current 
assignees.
1. Open the Assignment History tab on the patent record.
2. Expand the Reorder Assignment component if 
necessary.
3. Drag and drop the assignees to arrange them in the desired order.
4. Click Save.
Related information

First-Named Assignee (on page 759)
Copying Assignments to Child Records
When creating a child patent, IPfolio copies current assigneesfrom the parent to the child record for you.
Please bear in mind that IPfolio copies the Party and Ownership Type field values only.
Copying Assignments from Patent Family to Patent
When creating a patent from a patent family, IPfolio copies current assigneesfrom the Patent Family to the Patent for
you.
IPfolio copies the Party, Display Order, Ownership Type and Ownership Share [%] field values.
Please bear in mind that the data propagation takes place only upon the Patent creation. If later on an Assignee
is added to/removed from the Patent Family, this will NOT be copied over to the related child Patents, and will be
applicable only to the Patents that are created from the Patent Family after the change.
Implementation Details
There are certain fields that you need to include on the patent page layout (as well as in the Assignment History 
related list) for the Assignments module to work properly.
Page Layouts
âª Include All Assignees and First-Named Assignee on the patent page layout.
âª Show Display Order and other fields of interest in the Assignment History related list as needed.
Patent Reviews
Reviews are an important part of the patenting process. In IPfolio you can choose between Allowance Review and
Foreign Filing Review.
Page 234
IPfolio User Guide
âª Allowance Review helps you ensure that the claims and other key details are correct before issuance.
âª With Foreign Filing Review you can get input from inventors before proceeding with foreign filings.
Key Features
âª The Allowance and Foreign Filing reviews use the Patent Review object to store individual responses.
âª Patent review records are tightly bound to the related patent and share the same permissions.
âª We use Record Types (Salesforce Help) to accommodate different review types on a single review object.

Inventors
IPfolio distinguishes between IDF Inventors, Patent Inventors and Patent Family Inventors, the data being copied
from IDF Inventors to Patent/Patent Family Inventors upon creation.
IDF Inventors
An invention disclosure inventor is a Contact associated with an invention disclosure record.
In ven tio n D isclo su re In ven to r (ID F ) C o n ta c t
IDF-001 IDF-001/Abby Abby
Sample Inventor (IDF)
Inventor (IDF) records are:
âª Listed in the Inventor on IDFs related list.
âª Stored in the Inventor (IDF) object.
âª Linked to Contact records.
Page 237

Note:
âª A Contact record is required. If IPfolio canât find an existing Contact, it creates one.
âª An Inventor (IDF) record can be updated even if a Contact linked to it is inactive. This is necessary, e.g.,
to maintain awards flows for the employees who have left the company but are still eligible to receive
awards. On the portal, though, inactive Contacts are filtered out and are unavailable.
Important: Please make sure to have the First Name, Last Name and Email fields filled in on the Inventor
(IDF) record, as these are necessary for the Inventor to be copied to a Patent further on.
Patent Inventors
A patent inventor is a Party associated with a patent record.
P a te n t In v e n to r P a rty
P-001US P-001US/Abby Abby
Sample Patent Inventor
Patent inventor records are:
âª Listed in the Inventor related list on the patent record.
âª Stored in the Inventor object.
âª Linked to Party records.
Patent inventors are typically created by IPfolio during first filing.
Page 239
| 5 - Patent Lifecycle
Note: A Party record is required. If IPfolio canât find an existing Party, it creates one. Please mind that for a
Party to get created, the First Name, Last Name and Email fields need to be filled in on the Inventor (IDF)
record.
Duplicate Party Names in PatentInventors
When creating a Patent from an IDF, a Patent record is created with the Inventor linked to an existing matching
Party (and the Inventor (IDF) is updated with a reference to this existing matching Party), if
âª Use EmployeeID for matching (Admin Panel > Portal Settings > Use EmployeeID for matching) is checked, the
Inventor has the same Unique Employee ID as an existing Party, but a different email (the name can be the same
or different).
âª Use EmployeeID for matching is unchecked, the Inventor has the same email as an existing Party (the name can
be the same or different).
If the Duplicate Rule Prevent_Duplicate_Party_Names (Setup> Duplicate Rules> 
Prevent_Duplicate_Party_Names) is active, and you try to create a case where the Inventor has the same name as
an existing Party, but a different email or Employee ID, an error message will be displayed, and a new record will not
be created.
If Prevent_Duplicate_Party_Names is inactive and you try to create a case where the Inventor has the same name
as an existing Party, but a different email or Employee ID, a Patent will be created with the Inventor related to a new
Party record created, and the Inventor (IDF) will be updated with the reference to this new Party record.

Inventor Propagation (on page 241)
Adding Inventors to an Existing Patent
You can also add inventors to an already existing patent.
1. Open the Patent record.
2. Go to the Details tab.
3. Go to the Inventors section.
4. Click New.
5. Enter either a Party in the Party field or a Contact in New Party from HR List.
Page 240
IPfolio User Guide
More info: If you enter a Contact, for which a Party with the same name or Email exists, the system will use
this Party. Otherwise a new Party will be created.
As you enter data in the Party or New Party from HR List fields, a dropdown suggests the Inventor
Name, Email and Employee ID. You can also open the All Results window and view all the details in a more
comprehensive table format. The Employee ID is displayed in the dropdown if the Use EmployeeID for
matching setting is enabled (Admin Panel > Portal Settings > Use EmployeeID for matching).
Note: If the Patent's Client field is populated, the dropdown list suggests only the Party(-ies) listed
in the Client field (parent + subsidiary(-ies)).
Important: For the system to be able to detect the existing Party and suggest the Inventor Name,
Email and Employee ID in the dropdown, the value of the Party Type field on the Details page of 
the corresponding Party object should be set to "Person".
Patent Family Inventors
IPfolio automatically tracks inventors at the patent family level.
Patent family inventors are similar to patent inventors in that they are:
âª Copied from invention disclosure inventors during first filing.
âª Linked to parties.
Patent family inventors are different from patent inventors in that they:
âª Include inventors from all patents in the family.
âª Are updated by IPfolio as you add or remove inventors on individual patents.
Inventor Propagation
The patent module has three primary objects â Invention Disclosures, Patents, and Patent Families, each having its
own Inventor object that holds related inventors.
Page 241
| 5 - Patent Lifecycle
The Inventor object makes it possible to store multiple inventors for a single Invention Disclosure, Patent Family, or
Patent record.

Additional Details
âª IPfolio copies the Inventors (IDF) in order, but it does not maintain order thereafter.
âª IPfolio copies values for matching fields (field with the same API name) from the invention disclosure inventor to
the patent inventor on creation.
Note:
âª When using Approve for Filing on an IDF, all Inventors from both the primary Invention Disclosure and
all the associated Invention Disclosures in the Merged IDFs related list are copied over to the newly
created Patent.
âª When copying inventors from parent to child Patents, only IPfolio packaged fields are copied. Other
customer, local or standard, fields are ignored, so that the parent Patent information does not interfere
with the child Patent data.
âª Additional local and custom fields on the Inventor object that should be cloned from parent Patent
records to their child records can be specified in the field set Inventor Clone Fields.
Filing Strategy
A well-developed Filing Strategy protects and leverages your intellectual property effectively, providing a roadmap
for managing IP assets.
With the Filing Strategy module, you can define and set up a strategy for your IP applications in various jurisdictions
and in different filing phases. Various responsibilities (selecting and applying a Filing Strategy) can be assigned to
specific roles. Once set up, this convenient tool lets you execute the selected Strategy from the first filing through to
the national/regional filings.
Important: Filing Strategies are currently supported by Patents, Patent Families and Invention Disclosures.
Setting up Filing Strategies
Initially you need to define within the Filing Strategy which countries should be managed by it and the conditions
based on which the Filing Strategy should be applied.
Filing Strategies
The Filing Strategies object is used for the purposes of defining and administering data, and includes a name, a type
of IP, and a condition.
Figure 23. Filing Strategies Object
In the Countries tab all Filing Strategy countries (object Filing Strategy Country) and the various phases (object
Filing Strategy Phase) are shown. Additionally, the costs (on page 258) for each phase are being displayed below
each phase and the total costs at the top of the page. The total costs and phase costs are updated automatically 
when changes are made.
If prov appears next to a country name in the Filing Strategy, it indicates that the country has a provisional patent
application.
Page 243
| 5 - Patent Lifecycle
Tip: If you click on a phase or a country in the Countries tab of a Filing Strategy, a link takes you directly to
Filing Strategy Countries (on page 244) or Filing Strategy Phase (on page 246).
You can edit the phases and countries by simply clicking Edit and applying your changes.
Figure 24. Countries Tab
You can add Filing Strategy Countries (on page 244) to a Filing Strategy by clicking into the text field of a phase
and start typing the country code. You will see matching results appear. Click on the desired country code from the
results. The country will be added to your list.
You can archive Filing Strategies by ticking the checkbox Is Archived.
Tip: The sort order of phases which is subsequently shown in the country overview of an applied Filing
Strategy can be adapted in the object Filing Strategy Phase (on page 246). The field to be adapted is named 
Sort Order. Phases with value 1 will be shown first, value 2 second etc.
The corresponding phases and countries need to be set up separately in the respective objects (Filing Strategy
Countries (on page 244) / Filing Strategy Phase (on page 246)).
Filing Strategy Countries
This object enables you to add/create countries for Filing Strategies.
Page 244
IPfolio User Guide
Figure 25. Creation of a new Filing Strategy Country
A - Filing Strategy Country ID
Gets created automatically. It displays as FSC-Entry number of Filing Strategy Country. The Filing 
Strategy Country ID of the 28th entry of a Filing Strategy Country would therefore show as FSC-0028.
B - Filing Country
Select or create a Filing Country.
C - Provisional
Tick if a provisional application is required in the jurisdiction.
D - Filing Strategy
Select or create a Filing Strategy. The new country will be added to this Filing Strategy.
E - Phase
Select or create a Filing Strategy Phase. The new country will be added to this Phase.
Excluding Inactive Countries
It is possible to mark countries as inactive and thereby preventing them from being available on Filing Strategy
Countries.
Only active countries from the Countries object can be added to Filing Strategy Countries.
Note: If you attempt to mark a country as inactive that is already in use with one or more Filing Strategies,
an error message will be displayed. You will be prompted to remove the country from all affected Filing
Strategies before proceeding.
Page 245
| 5 - Patent Lifecycle
To deactivate a country and therefore make it unavailable to Filing Strategy Countries follow these steps:
1. Search for Countries in the App Launcher.
2. Search for the country you want to set as inactive.
3. Open the country record.
4. Go to Related> Inactive and tick the box.
The country is now marked as inactive and will be excluded in the future.
Note: Existing records are unaffected by this change, meaning that inactive countries are not removed from
previously established Filing Strategies, Invention Disclosures, and Patent Families
Filing Strategy Phase
This object enables you to add new phases to/edit the various phases of your Filing Strategy.
Figure 26. Creation of a new Filing Strategy Phase

9. Click Save.
Filing Strategy Conditions
Defining conditions lets you manipulate data more effectively.
In order to define a condition for the Filing Strategy, you need to enter the API name of a formula field.
You could for example define if a certain cost center should be used. When selecting a Filing Strategy the condition
will be checked and if the condition has been met the corresponding Filing Strategy will be shown and vice versa.
The formula field has to be created in the Formula Manager Object. In order for the formula to work for Filing
Strategy, certain conditions have to be met:
Page 248
IPfolio User Guide
1. The conditions entered in the formula field itself need to be written in Salesforce Formula Syntax.
2. The type of the formula field has to be Boolean (checkbox).
3. If the formula evaluates to True, the Filing Strategy can be selected.
Importing Data with the Data Wizard
If you want to bulk update Filing Strategy Countries, you can make use of the Data Import Wizard functionality
powered by Salesforce
Make sure that you import your .csv data to Filing Strategy Countries.

Strategy Countries are also copied.
Selecting a Filing Strategy
Selecting a Filing Strategy involves choosing and adapting the proper Filing Strategy for a specific Invention
Disclosure or Patent Family.
After configuring your Filing Strategies (see Setting Up a Filing Strategy (on page 243)), the Filing Strategy can be
selected and applied within an Invention Disclosure or Patent Family.
This task is not mandatory, but it provides important information to those who subsequently apply the Filing 
Strategy (on page 252).
1. Open the required Invention Disclosure or Patent Family record.
2. Click Select Filing Strategy in the Quick Action bar.
Result: The Select Filing Strategy window opens.
3. Enter the required values in the Select Filing Strategy window:
a. Select which Filing Strategy is to be used. In the Filing Strategy Details on the upper right side
of the window, all Countries and Phases of the selected Filing Strategy are listed as well as the
estimated costs of each Phase and the total Costs.
b. Describe who made the decision regarding the Filing Strategy in the field Decision Made By
c. Add annotations as needed in the Annotation field to give information on which countries
need to be added/removed from which Phases (for example: +CA +WO PCT Nat. Phase, -AT EP
Validation).
d. Add a decision date by clicking on the calendar icon next to the Decision Date field and selecting
a date. If no date is selected, the current date is used.
4. Click Save. The selection of the Filing Phase is completed. The next step is the application of the selected 
Filing Strategy (on page 252).

Note:
The Annotation text, Decision Made By and Decision Date can be seen by the IP Admin who is
subsequently applying the Filing Strategy. The Admin can see at a glance if there are changes to be
made to the current Filing Strategy, who made the changes and when these changes were decided.
If nothing is entered in Decision Made By or Annotation, this information is not displayed during
the application step of the Filing Strategy.

Applying a Filing Strategy
Filing Strategies need to be applied and adapted based on requirements communicated during the selection of a
Filing Strategy.
After clicking Apply Filing Strategy you are able to
âª see who defined the Filing Strategy and
âª the annotations made during the selection, if there are any.
Note: It is not mandatory to annotate a Filing Strategy.
After clicking Next you will be taken to the Country selection screen.
Applying a Filing Strategy - Country Selection
In this screen, countries and phases are preselected from the chosen Filing Strategy. You can see the annotations
given in the previous steps and you can add (on page 253) or delete (on page 253) countries. Costs for each phase 
are displayed below the respective phases, with the total costs at the top of the page. The total costs and phase
costs are updated automatically when changes are made.
âª represents deleted countries,
âª represents added countries and
âª represents preselected countries.
If prov appears next to a country name, it indicates that the country has a provisional patent application.
After clicking Save, the Filing Strategy is applied and the Filing Strategy Country records can be viewed in the Filing
Strategy Tab of the Invention Disclosure. There you can find information on
Page 252
IPfolio User Guide
âª the annotations
âª countries that have been selected/added
âª countries that have been removed
The Filing Strategy entry for additionally added countries remains empty in the Applied Filing Strategy Country
records. Removed countries are designated as Removed in the Action column.
Adding Countries
You can add countries by
âª clicking the text field under the respective phase and
âª entering the country code that needs to be added. Suggestions based on your input are displayed in the text
field.
For example, we would like to add country code ZA. Simply enter the initials in the corresponding field of a phase
and select the country. ZA subsequently gets added to the corresponding Filing Strategy Phase.
Deleting Countries
Delete countries by clicking next to a specific country code. If we delete AT from EP Validation, the result would
show up as follows:
Note: Whenever you add countries during the Application of a Filing Strategy and subsequently delete
them from the Filing Strategy Tab, these country records are deleted from the Filing Strategy Tab. They are
not used in the creation of Child Records. If you apply a Filing Strategy and subsequently want to delete a
country, which is initially set up in a Filing Strategy object, these country records show up as removed in the
Filing Strategy Tab. They are also not used in the creation of Child Records.
Multiple Filing Strategies
You can also apply multiple Filing Strategies with multiple phases within a Patent Family/ Invention Disclosure Form
and for corresponding Patents.
During the Application of the Filing Strategy, all phases with at least one already created Patent are locked and
cannot be edited.
Page 253
| 5 - Patent Lifecycle
The remaining phases are editable. After the application of the new Filing Strategy, all unaffected records of the
previously applied Filing Strategy are marked as removed.
Figure 29. Multiple Filing Strategies applied in Patent Family
Note: If an Invention Disclosure has already been Approved for Filing or is in one of the following statuses
AND a related Patent Family record exists, you cannot apply another Filing Strategy:
âª Approved for Filing
âª Declared as Trade Secret
âª Defensive Publication
âª Patent(s) Filed
âª Patent(s) Issued
âª Record Closed
âª Merged
Instead, you can apply the Filing Strategy directly in the Patent Family.
Executing a Filing Strategy
Learn how to Approve a Filing Strategy and Create Child Records from the Filing Strategy after a Filing Strategy was
applied.
Approve for Filing
If a Filing Strategy was selected beforehand, a country is being preselected after you click on Approve for Filing.
Countries in the phase First Filing will be shown by default. In our sample case the country for which the phase is set
to First Filing is WO.
Page 254
IPfolio User Guide
Note: If multiple First Filings are configured, the functionality Approve for Filing will create all First Filing
records. In this case, the Approve for Filing screen will be shown in a loop until all First Filings are finished.
Only one patent family will be created at the first iteration.
After the Patent Record is created, you will be automatically redirected to the newly created Patent Family.
All the applied Filing Strategy countries and details are copied to this Patent family. The countries can still be
amended in the Patent family afterwards. This ensures that later on countries can be added or removed. This option
is found under the Patent family in the Filing Strategy tab. The Filing Strategy in the Invention Disclosure is locked
and cannot be changed.
Note: If Invention Disclosures are not utilized by the user, all features are available at the Family Level.
Creating Child Records
Page 255
| 5 - Patent Lifecycle
In order to create Child Records from a Patent Record based on the application of a Filing Strategy, you need to
navigate to the created Patent Records.
In the Create Child Records window the relationship to the parent based on the Filing Strategy phase is displayed if
there is one.
Figure 30. Child Record Creation - Example EP
In the example above we try to create child records from the newly created EP patent. Based on the settings in the
Filing Strategy Phase object for the country EP and the phase EP Validation you can now create the corresponding
Child Records.
Direct Link to EPV Portal
If you are using the EP Validation service, you can also configure a button to take you directly to the EPV Portal. If a
Filing Strategy was selected beforehand, the jurisdictions will be preselected there:
Page 256
IPfolio User Guide
If a Filing Strategy was not selected beforehand, the jurisdictions will not be preselected.
Relation Logic
The list of countries on the Create Child Record(s) screen should be pre-populated depending on the Filing Strategy
and the phase of the current record. The countries are shown in alphabetical order.
The countries / relationship to parent logic functions as follows:
âª Check the phases where the IP type matches or is empty
âª Check the phases where the country code is empty
Page 257
| 5 - Patent Lifecycle
1. If the corresponding patent records donât exist, the countries for that matching phase show up in the
Create Child Record(s) List
2. Else revert to the original logic
You can also edit the fields manually.
Creating New Filing Strategy Patent From Patent Families
Filing Strategy Patents can be created directly from Patent Families.
A Filing Strategy must have been applied to a Patent Family and First Filing Countries must not have been created
yet.
1. Navigate to a Patent Family with an applied Filing Strategy.
2. Click Create Patent.
Result: A new screen opens with information on the applied Filing Strategy and a preselected First Filing
Country.
3. Click Save.
4. If there are multiple First Filing Countries in your Filing Strategy, click Save & New to cover all countries.
The Patent is created as an Applied Filing Strategy Country record.
Filing Strategy Costs
It is possible to assign Costs with different cost types to Filing Strategy Countries to get an overview on the
projected Costs.
When selecting a Filing Strategy (on page 251), you can see at a glance the estimated Costs of the Filing Strategy in
question:
Page 258
IPfolio User Guide
Figure 31. Cost Overview
Calculation of Filing Strategy Costs
The data used for calculating Filing Strategy Costs derives from the Filing Strategy Country Cost Object (on page
259). There you can establish relations between Filing Strategy Countries and Costs. The calculation logic is as
follows:
No related Costs
Default Costs (on page 260) are used for calculating Filing Strategy Costs.
No related Costs + no Default Costs
Filing Strategy Costs = 0.
Relation to a single Cost
The value of the Cost is used for calculating Filing Strategy Costs.
Relation to multiple Costs
The Costs are added and the sum of Costs is used for calculating Filing Strategy Costs.
If no Costs are configured, the message Estimated Costs: Not configured is displayed.
Filing Strategy Country Cost
This object enables you to establish relations between Filing Strategy Countries and Costs.
This data is used for calculating Filing Strategy Costs. These calculations are displayed during the selection of a 
Filing Strategy (on page 251).

Cost Estimates Timeline
The Cost Estimates Timeline is a visual tool that allows users to view cost estimates for Filing Strategies over a
specified period.
The timeline can display up to 30 years of data, with a scrollable interface to navigate through the years.
Page 261
| 5 - Patent Lifecycle
Figure 34. Cost Estimates Timeline Example
Each Filing Strategy cost object (Filing Strategy Country Cost (on page 259) and Filing Strategy Default Cost
Estimate (on page 260)) includes a Year field where the year the cost is due can be entered. This field is responsible
for placing the cost estimates correctly on the Cost Estimates Timeline.
When cost objects are created or updated with year values, these changes are automatically reflected in the Cost 
Estimates Timeline.
Documents
IPfolio provides multiple opportunities and convenient ways to manage documents on your invention disclosure and
patent records.
Page 262
IPfolio User Guide
Export Control
Some countries have export control laws that restrict foreign nationals from accessing technical documents, like
those found in patent applications.
Export control restrictions no longer apply when:
âª A foreign filing license is obtained.
âª The application is published or issued.
âª 12 months have passed after the Filing Date.
Until then, the IP team is required to prevent foreign nationals from accessing files on patents subject to export
controls.
IPfolio can help manage this process in two ways:
âª IPsync customers can exclude documents by document type.
âª Customers can exclude all documents on specified records.
Excluding Documents By Type
IPsync downloads the complete Image File Wrapper for US applicationsââ including restricted documents. You can
exclude specific document types from downloading until a foreign filing license is obtained (or the restrictions are
otherwise lifted.)
Related information
IPsync (on page 291)
How It Works
âª You specify the document types to exclude during setup.
âª Our provider excludes the specified document types initially.
âª Once the requirements are met, the documents are re-added and included in IPsync downloads.
Export control restrictions no longer apply when, for example:
âª A foreign filing license is obtained.
âª The application is published or issued.
âª 12 months have passed after the Filing Date.
The primary advantage of this technique is that it is entirely automated after initial setup.
However, since the documents are not downloaded, they are not available to anyone on the team until the export
control requirements are met. Additionally, this approach does not prevent access to documents added in other
ways.
Note: Our data provider charges a one-time setup fee.

Excluding Documents Using Groups
Alternatively, you can manually restrict access to documents on specific applications, to specific users.
To exclude documents manually:
âª You create specially named, country-specific Chatter groups, following the naming format: âAll {{Country Code}}
Employeesâ.
âª You manage group members manually.
âª You select the Subject to Export Control checkbox on specific patents, and control read/write access as needed.
For example, follow this procedure to give US employees access to Documents on US patent âP001-USâ (and
remove access to documents for all other users):
Page 265
| 5 - Patent Lifecycle
1. Create a Chatter group called âAll US Employeesâ.
2. Add group members and click Done.
Page 266
IPfolio User Guide
3. Select Subject to Export Control on patent P001-US.
Result: IPfolio shares all documents for P001-US with users of the âAll US Employeesâ Chatter group.
IPfolio restricts all documents for all other users.
When Subject to Export Control is selected on a patent, IPfolio:
âª Removes access to all documents.
âª Looks for a Chatter group named âAll {{Country Code}} Employeesâ.
âª Shares documents with members of the Chatter group.
Deselecting Subject to Export Control re-shares documents normally.
This approach:
âª Gives you more control. You manage the user groups, and included applications.
âª Blocks all documents, regardless of how they are added.
However, this approach requires ongoing supervision of user groups and applications.
Note:
Older orgs may use CRM Content to store files. Newer orgs may use Salesforce Files to store files.
This feature requires Salesforce Files. For customers still using CRM Content, a separate file upgrade/
migration project is required before this feature is available.
For more details please contact your System Administrator or the IPfolio Premium Services Team.

Layout Options
The Portal Attachments component displays documents added by inventors on the invention disclosure records.
Portal Attachments
On invention disclosures, files added by inventors appear in Notes and Attachments. Files added in the Documents 
section by the IP team also appear in Notes and Attachments. This made it difficult to tell which files were added by
inventors, and which files were added by the team.
Page 267
| 5 - Patent Lifecycle
We created an Attachments component on Invention Disclosures that only shows files submitted by inventors.
To make this even clearer, we have changed the default title of this component to Portal Attachments. (The title is 
editable, so you can change it if desired.)
Opt-out of IPsync Documents to Save Space
You can opt out of retrieving IPsync documents of certain types to save space.
IPsync compares IPfolio data to external data, and:
âª Adds missing bibliographic data to your records.
âª Reconciles differences in bibliographic data.
âª Downloads available documents.
For US records, this means downloading the complete Image File Wrapper.
Downloading the complete Image File Wrapper is extremely helpful. However, downloaded files count against your
file storage quota. For large portfolios, this can be an issue.
You can choose to not download specific Image File Wrapper files. All documents downloaded from Patent Center
include a Document Code that uniquely identifies the document type. For example, the document code for a Notice
of Allowance is âNOAâ.
Weâve added an IPsync File Opt-out List option in the Admin Panel. Adding a comma-separated list of document
codes to IPsync File Opt-out List instructs IPfolio to not retrieve documents of these types. Instead, we create a link
to the file. When selected, we retrieve and download the file in real-time.
Publication and Reference Management
You can manage prior art publications and citations in the Publication/Reference Management module.
The publication/reference management module (formerly named Prior Art Management Module and also known 
as the IDS Module), lets you create publications and manage citations in the system along with your IP records.
The publication/reference management module includes:
Page 268
IPfolio User Guide
âª A repository of publication records.
âª The âCited Reference (Patents)â, âCited Reference (Third Party Patents)â and âCited Reference (IDF)â objects,
used to track individual citations for patents, third party patents and IDFs.
âª The âNon Cited Referenceâ object, a repository of publications explicitly excluded from being cited on patent
applications.
The publication/reference management module also includes:
âª The âIDS Matrixâ, a graphical tool used to cross-cite references within and across patent families.
âª The âGenerate IDS Formâ Quick Action, used to generate completed SB08 forms.
Publications
The Publications library lists all your patent and non-patent references.
The Publication object is the central repository of all publication records. It contains a single record for each
publication, regardless of how many times it is cited.
Click Publications on the navigation bar to display the list of references.

publications library.
If you enter a patent or publication number WITH a Kind Code, the meta data and document returned will reflect 
the given Kind Code version. If there is no match in IP ONE Data, the Publication record will be created without
retrieving any metadata or documents.
If you enter a patent or publication number WITHOUT a Kind Code, the Publication will be created with the latest 
version of the Patent/Publication in IP ONE Data (and appending the Kind Code to the Publication ID). If there is
no match in IP ONE Data, the Publication record will be created without the Kind Code and without retrieving any
metadata or documents.

âApplicant Citedâ, and adds them to the SB08 form. SB08 forms are saved to the Documents section of the current 
patent record.
This feature remembers the citations youâve already included on an SB08 and offers to adjust subsequent versions
accordingly. The first time you click Generate IDS Form, it automatically includes all references marked âTo be
Citedâ. If you then click Generate IDS Form on the same application, and there are no new references, it simply 
offers to Re-generate the SB08 form.
However, if you click Generate IDS Form and it finds new references (marked âTo be Citedâ), you get the following
prompt: You have new references and an existing SB08 form. Do you want to create a new form with the new 
citations, or re-create the last form with the new citations added?â.
1. Open the required patent record.
2. Click Generate IDS Form.
Evidence of Use
The Evidence of Use module helps you identify potentially infringing products in the marketplace.
If our Products module lets you map patents to products, enhancing visibility into your portfolio, and helping you
manage your IP strategically,
our Evidence of Use (EOU) module takes this a step further, enabling you to track evidence of use as part of your
larger infringement/assertion/licensing efforts.

Related information
Objects (on page 532)
Details
The EOU object is a join object, located between patents and products. For a given patent/product combination, you
can add one or more EOU records to document Evidence of Use.
EOU records have a Phase field, analogous to a âstatusâ field, used to track the stage of the EOU analysis. Phases
include:
âª Draft
âª Peer Review
âª Legal Review
âª Claim Chart
âª Date(s) Shown
âª Completed
Note: When updating a Phase, also the Current Phase Date field in EOU records will be updated 
automatically.
Core Features
Evidence of Use comes with the core IPfolio functionality youâve come to expect, including Documents and 
Inbound/Outbound Email from individual records. EOU records include a convenient Patent and Product Details
section that show key details from related patent and product records.
EOU Campaign
The Evidence of Use module also includes a related EOU Campaign object. EOU Campaign is a grouping object, 
grouping EOU records, the same way patent and trademark âfamilyâ records do. Grouping EOU records is especially
helpful when documenting coverage for licensing and enforcement.
Patent Acquisition
Sophisticated IP users sometimes purchase patents, or whole portfolios, to use strategically. Companies often
acquire patents when they acquire other companies. Either way, our Patent Acquisition module can help customers
integrate IP assets.
The module consists of the Acquisition Patent and Acquisition Campaign objects:
âª Acquisition Patent is a join object, located between Publication and Acquisition Campaign.
âª Acquisition Campaign is a grouping object, grouping Acquisition Patent records into âcampaignsâ.

How to Use the Patent Acquisition Module
To use the module, you need to create an Acquisition Campaign, then add existing third party patents (which live in
the Publication object) by creating Acquisition Patent join records.
1. Click Acquisition Campaigns on the Navigation Bar.
2. Click New.
3. Click Save.
4. Open the Relations tab on the newly-created Acquisition Campaign.
5. Go to the Acquisition Patents related list
Page 285
| 5 - Patent Lifecycle
6. Click New.
7. Fill in the Acquisition Patent field with the patent number and click Save.

Eligible Records
IPsync works with publicly available records from eligible Jurisdictions (on page 291).
IPsync works with some private records, namely Patent Center Private View records you make available to us.
To make Patent Center Private View records available to us:
âª Each firm creates a Customer Number they use for your applications.
âª Each firm adds you to the Customer Number so you see those applications when you login to Patent Center.
Your goal is to see the correct Customer Numbers and applications when you login to Patent Center.
âª Once that is done, you âsponsor usâ (so we see what you see.)
âª Until then, keep working with your firms to âclean upâ your Customer Numbers and applications, and let us know
when that is done.

Documents
IPsync downloads files to the Documents section of the current record. We process downloaded .pdf files to make
them text searchable in IPfolio.
âª For US records, IPsync downloads the complete Image File Wrapper and saves them in a folder called âPAIRâ.
âª For non-US records, IPsync downloads available prosecution documents and saves them in a folder called
âOfficial Registerâ.
Patent Center documents include a unique feature that enables us to use them auto-docket actions. Each Patent
Center document includes a Document Code that uniquely identifies the document type. Because we can tell if a 
downloaded Patent Center document is a Notice of Allowance, a Non-Final Rejection, or any other type of office action,
we use Patent Center documents to auto-docket actions.
Note: Patent Center documents are the only documents used to docket actions.
Sync Details
IPsync does not get data from PTOs directly. Instead, we use a data provider whose primary focus is collecting and
updating data from various jurisdictions.
Daily Checks
Our provider checks PTO records daily, looking for status updates that indicate meaningful changes have occurred.
They update their records accordingly. IPsync focuses on reconciling (or âsyncingâ) data in your IPfolio records with
the normalized data supplied by our provider.
Page 293
| 5 - Patent Lifecycle
Note: Our data provider scrapes data from various PTOs. IPsync synchronizes your IPfolio data with data
from our provider, looking for discrepancies.
Understanding this separation is helpful, especially when trying to understand when updates appear in IPfolio. For
example:
It is accurate to say IPsync compares IPfolio records with our providerâs records daily. But it also helps to remember:
âª The data needs to be available from the PTO.
âª Our provider needs time to get the updates.
âª We need time to sync your records with data from our provider.
Many updates docketed at the PTO are available in IPfolio the following day. Applications filed late in the day are
likely processed by the PTO the following day, and appear in IPfolio the day after that.
A good rule of thumb is that updates docketed at the PTO are generally available in IPfolio 2-3 days after you see
them in Patent Center Private View (former Private PAIR).
Important: Patents and Trademarks in the Closed, Lapsed, or Sold (+ Finally Lapsed for Patents) status are
not synced, and their statuses don't get updated upon IPsync data retrieval.
Advanced Scraper
As stated above, most updates are available 2-3 days after they appear in Patent Center Private View. However,
there are exceptions.
A small subset of actions may take considerably longer, the most notable example being a Response to Office Action. 
These may take 7-10 days (or longer) due to how they are processed by the USPTO.
Our provider offers an advanced scraping option that reduces the wait for these actions. There is an additional fee
since this requires them to scrape all records every day (as opposed to those the PTO marks as updated.) There are
three options (sorted in descending order by cost.)
âª Perform an immediate update of applications every day.
âª In addition to the standard daily update service, perform an immediate update of pending applications every 3
calendar days.
âª In addition to the standard daily update service, perform an immediate update of pending applications every 7
calendar days.
Note: Advanced Scraping is required for WO / CN sync since there is no monitored date to be used.
Discrepancy Reconciliation
IPsync primarily uses the Application Number to match IPfolio records with PTO records.
If no Application Number is found in an IPfolio record, the system tries to populate it with the USPTO value, based
on matching Attorney Docket Number and Law Firm Reference numbers in the respective records.
Bibliographic fields are handled as follows:
Page 294
IPfolio User Guide
âª If your value and the PTO value are the same, no action is taken.
âª If your field is empty, and the PTO has a value, we add the PTO value to your record.
âª If your value and the PTO value differ, we do not change your record. Instead, we create a Data Audit entry 
noting the difference.
See Data Audits (on page 364) for details.
Note: When the system tries to create new Data Audit Logs related to a record whose Owner is inactive,
it assigns any other System Administrator of the org, whose email does not contain @ipfolio or 
@clarivate, as owner of these new Data Audit Logs, and the sync is successfully completed.

PatentStrengthâ¢
IP One Data includes Innographyâs PatentStrengthâ¢ score (found in the Patent Strength Indicator field on patents)
â an algorithmic estimate of âstrengthâ providing a predictive indicator for a patentâs likelihood of being involved
with litigation.
PatentStrengthâ¢ is widely recognized in the industry as an objective scoring mechanism and is used in diverse
verticals for comparing a portfolio to an industry or competitive portfolios. PatentStrengthâ¢ scores how strong a
specific patent is and can vary between 0 and 100. The higher the score, the stronger the patent. (A score of 70 and 
higher is generally considered âstrong.â)
Algorithm:
The algorithm is based on a regression analysis of litigated patents and strongly correlated with patents that end up 
in litigation. While the exact logic is proprietary, the following items are considered in calculating Patent Strength:
Litigation
This is a key item â extensive research indicates that litigation correlates strongly with
strength. Algorithm considers patents involved in litigation as well as patents opposed 
during filing. Strong patents are defended, often heavily, by their owners. Patents not
directly involved in a litigation are also considered in the strength calculation, although 
the impact on the score is very minimal.
Claims Patent claims describe the scope of protection that has been granted by the patent.
More claims indicate broader protection for the patented technology.
References References are the technology and prior art that a patent stands upon. More references 
indicate a broader technology base and, consequently, a stronger patent.
Classifications A number of main-group classification codes are used to identify patents in important 
technological fields.
Citations Citations indicate that the patent is used as prior art. The more frequently a given patent 
is cited, the more foundationalâand therefore valuableâit tends to be.
Expiration Expired patents are not as strong or valuable in comparison with active ones.
Using this approach, different patents are objectively compared, and the result - a normalized patent strength score
- is weekly recalculated and mapped against a distribution curve across all patents.
Where does this come from?
Innographyâs PatentStrengthâ¢ algorithm is based on the paper Valuable Patents by John R. Allison, Mark A. Lemley,
Kimberly A. Moore, and R. Derek Trunkey. Covering nearly 3,000,000 patents and over 4,000 patent lawsuits, it
is the most comprehensive study of the patent system, and associated value, ever conducted. Starting from the
basic assumption that patents are litigated because of their intrinsic value, the researchers explored additional
Page 300
IPfolio User Guide
characteristics of these patents. We have extended and refined this research into our proprietary PatentStrengthâ¢
calculations.
Documents
IP One Data downloads the Publication and Grant PDFs for eligible records.
Note:
For issued patents, we download the Grant PDF only.
Not all PDFs are text-searchable. However, some are, including:
âª US documents are OCRâd by IP One from approximately 2001 on
âª EP documents are provided in OCRâd form directly from the EPO
âª WO documents are provided in OCRâd form directly from WIPO
Sync Details
IP One Data checks eligible records for updates weekly. You can check for updates on individual records anytime. IP
One Data only checks active patents.
Note: Patents with a status of âNot Filedâ, âClosedâ, âSoldâ, âLapsedâ, or âFinally Lapsedâ are considered
inactive. All other statuses are considered âactiveâ.
Discrepancy Reconciliation
IPsync and IP One Data use the same Data Audits (Sync Logs) feature, letting you âAcceptâ or âDiscardâ proposed
changes.
However, there are important differences between how the two services match records. This affects the Data Audit
changes we propose too.
IPsync
IPsync matches internal and external records primarily by Application Number. When a match is found, it
automatically populates empty fields, and creates Data Audits when there is a discrepancy.
Key takeaways:
âª IPsync matches on a single field.
âª Matches are binary â there is either a match or there isnât.
âª IPsync behaves the same for all matches. (Populating empty fields and creating Data Audits when there is a
discrepancy.)
See IPsync (on page 291) for details.
IP One Data
IP One Data searches for matching records from a vast array of public records from many different jurisdictions,
using a complex algorithm that considers multiple fields to find matches.
When a match is found, a unique identifier is returned that detects a specific case in the IP One Data system.
Page 301
| 5 - Patent Lifecycle
Two important data points that are essential for a match to occur:
1. The jurisdiction of the case must be supported by IP One Data coverage. We currently cover over 175
jurisdictions for bibliographic information and 75+ jurisdictions for full text information, our main sources
being the EPO and the USPTO. We also supplement information from third-party sources.
2. A match can only be performed against published applications. IP One Data doesnât have access to prepublished applications.
Confidence of Match
IP One Data assigns a score of High/Medium/Low/None to express its confidence that it has identified the correct
record.
For a bigger chance of a high confidence match, as much of the following data as possible is recommended to be sent
to IP One Data:
âª Country Code (required)
âª Filing Type (or Type Code (on page 303) - the filing route of the application, to be indicated in the IPR Subtype 
field)
âª Publication Number
âª Application Number
âª Grant Number
âª Application Date
âª Publication Date
âª Grant Date
âª Inventor(s)
âª Title
Other data that donât influence the confidence:
âª PCT Number
âª PCT Date
âª Parent Number
âª Parent Date
The algorithm categorizes numbers, dates and text fields from the above list and uses a scoring mechanism by
assigning a series of points from positive to negative for each value that is matched/not matched with public data to
suggest a confidence in the match:
1. The numbers (application, publication, grant) are compared as a first pass and receive a positive/negative
point based on a match.
2. The dates (filing, publication, grant) are then compared and assigned a validation score increasing or
decreasing the confidence.
3. The text fields are the last category that also play a part in the confidence but doesnât majorly alter it.
According to the number of corresponding values sent in the request, matching results are graded in one of the four
categories and determine how IP One Data handles data from the matched record:
âª High: A high confidence match would most likely occur when as many above-mentioned fields as possible
are sent and matched. For example, if three values from the Dates or Numbers (Application, Publication, or
Grant) are identical or, in addition, a text field like Inventor is matched. Like with IPsync, values will be written
Page 302
IPfolio User Guide
immediately into empty fields in IPfolio (unless the field is included in the 'Always Create Sync Log' field set), and
Sync Logs are created for discrepancies (i.e., there is already an existing value in IPfolio).
âª Medium: The (Dates Filing, Publication, and Grant) are compared in addition to the Numbers and results
increase or decrease the confidence of a match. If none of the dates are provided, the best case is medium
confidence. A Data Audit (Sync Log) will always be generated, just like for any fields that are configured in the
'Always Create Sync Log' field set.
âª Low: No data will be written, and no Sync Log created. The matching attempt is only logged in the IP One Sync
Details object. This occurs when minimal or incorrect data is sent in the request. Low confidence match does not
always mean that the return is not an accurate match. The algorithm cannot conclusively attest to the validity
because there is too little information available.
âª None: No match was found because:
âª Incorrect information was provided, OR
âª The application has not been published yet, OR
âª The jurisdiction or the IP Type is not supported by IP One Data. For example: Design coverage is very sparse
in IP One Data or there are countries where the EPO lacks coverage for certain countries, or the coverage
is delayed (For example: India, Hong Kong, Korea, China, Italy, Germany and more). Countries where data
is up to date can be referenced from the IP One Data (IP1D) Coverage Guide - see page 5, Table 3: Patent
Coverage Summary (The entry 'Present' in the 'Latest Date' column indicates that the jurisdiction is up-todate as of the latest available information.).
âLast Match Successfulâ
Last Match Successful indicates whether a potential match was found the last time the system checked.
âª âTrueâ indicates a potential match in the IP One database.
âª âFalseâ indicates no match was found.
Type Code
Type Code is the 'filing route' of an application and an important attribute that increases the likelihood of a high
confidence match in case of EP designated countries, PCT nationalized countries. Consumers can concatenate 
the IP Right and filing types in the IPR Subtype field in the Match Request and all concatenated values will be 
appropriately considered in determining a match candidate. For example: DEN_EUR for an EU design, UTM_PCT for
PCT Utility model.
Type Codes that are currently supported:
Code Description
ARP ARIPO Patent Application
EAR Eurasian Patent Application
EUR European Patent Application
Page 303
| 5 - Patent Lifecycle
Code Description
PCT PCT Application
When a Type Code is applicable to a case, the Country Code should show the designated country.
Interpretations/Possible Explanations of Scores
âª A High Confidence match can almost always be treated as an accurate match. We recommend that a user
review be involved with Medium and Low Confidence matches.
âª Low Confidence is typically the result of bad data or too little data in IPfolio:
IP One has found a record that could be a match, but there is too little information or contradictory information.
For example, if only an Application Number is provided in IPfolio, and/or the Filing Date or Publication Number
(or other Date and/or Number), which the matching logic could use as supporting evidence that it found the
correct record, is mistyped, the system will likely return a Low Confidence rating.
âª No Match typically means there is no published record, the possible reasons being:
1. an unsupported or lagging jurisdiction (e.g., India, Italy) or type of IP (Designs, Trademarks), or
2. a type of patent that doesnât get separately published by the patent offices (most EP national
validations), or
3. the application not being published yet, or being a provisional, or similar.
âª If there is more than one Filing, Publication, or Grant event in the case, the event with the latest performed date
is used.
âª The algorithm takes into consideration various number formats per jurisdiction and publication date (for
jurisdictional number format updates over time), special characters, trailing and leading spaces and zeros before
executing the match.
âª Grant dates for the following jurisdictions are calculated from the legal status events (JP, AR, BR, PT, HK) and
cannot guarantee accuracy.
âª Australian grant dates that we receive from the EPO have also been unreliable and are returned with a â301â
status code that can be flagged in the consuming system.
Sample IP One Sync Detail Record
In the following hypothetical example, a customer checked the IP One Sync Details and found:
âª Confidence of Match: âLowâ
âª Last Match Successful: âTrueâ
Both can affect whether data is imported into IPfolio, but for different reasons:
âª A Last Match Successful value of âTrueâ means the system found a potential match in the IP One database. 
(âFalseâ would indicate no match found.)
âª A Confidence of Match value of âLowâ indicates that although there may be a match, the system canât be certain
it is the right record.
Either way, no data is imported. (No action is taken when matching confidence is âLowâ.)

Chapter 6. Trademark Lifecycle
With IPfolio you can create, manage and track your trademarks from trademark search requests throughout their
entire lifecycle.
Trademark Search Requests
A trademark search request is usually the first stage in the trademark workflow.
The trademark search request process typically includes the following steps:
1
2
3
4
1. Submit trademark search request (on page 306)
2. Request searches (on page 307)
3. Decision (on page 307)
4. Create trademark (on page 307)
Submittrademark search request
Employees create Trademarks Search Requests to submit candidates for new product or service names to the IP
team for review and clearance. While trademark search requests are typically created by employees using the IP
portal, the IP team can create these records directly in IPfolio too.
Page 306
IPfolio User Guide
Figure 39. Trademark search request record
TSR records include:
âª Common fields like Owner (typically the paralegal responsible for the record), In-House Counsel and Status.
âª A section for Outside Counsel
âª A designated record image.
Trademark search requests also include a section with request details, like the proposed mark, its usage, and
meaning. Depending on how savvy they are, you may ask business users for details like proposed goods and services
or proposed countries of protection on the submission form.
Advanced configuration options, such as allowing the submission of multiple Proposed Marks in one TSR (and, e.g.,
uploading documents to each specific Proposed Mark record), or tracking multiple searches and search results by
country or provider in a separate list, are available.
Request searches
Use the Search Instructions action to send instructions to Outside Counsel or another search service.
The decision and clearance process often includes a broad âPreliminary Searchâ, followed by a more thorough search
in specific countries, often referred to as the âFull Searchâ. The Trademark Search Request object includes fields for
tracking when these searches were initiated, which providers were used, as well as the results of the searches.
Decision
Use the Decision action to record the decision on the trademark search request.
Create trademark
Use the Create Trademark action (on the trademark search request) to create the trademark record in the desired
country of first filing. 1
1. Use the action to ensure this step is completed correctly.
Page 307
| 6 - Trademark Lifecycle
Note: The first trademark filing creates a Trademark Family record in the background. The trademark family
groups the first filing and any subsequent filings together. Family records can store information about the
family (as opposed to individual trademarks). They can be helpful for reporting purposes.
Tip: The Record ID for trademarks and numbering convention is configurable. The Keep Patent/TM IDs in
Sync with IDF/TSR ID custom setting governs whether the sequential number of the TSR will be taken over
as the sequential number of the Trademark and Family that is being created (setting ON), vs. numbering
Trademarks and Families sequentially, independently of the TSR (setting OFF).
Each trademark record corresponds to a filing in a specific country (and a specific class in single-class jurisdictions).
All subsequent prosecution activity is managed on individual trademark records. Later, if you receive an opposition
or use one or several trademarks in litigation, you create corresponding conflict records and link them to the
appropriate trademark records.
Note: If a Trademark is related to an IP Contract that has certain countries listed in the Exclusion Countries
field, when you try to create a child record from this Trademark in one of those countries (using the Create 
Child Record(s) or Create TM Filing Instruction buttons), you will get an error message saying that based
on this Contract you cannot file a Trademark in the specified country and have to remove it to continue.
TM Search Request Status
Trademark search requests go through several different status values which indicate the stage of the record and
what needs to be done next.
IPfolio sets Status automatically using the following logic:
Status When
Draft User starts a new search request but doesnât submit it.
Submitted for Review User clicks Submit for Review on the IP Portal to submit search request.
In Search IP team uses Search Instructions action to request search.
Cleared IP team selects âApproved for Use Without Filingâ from Decision action.
Approved for Filing IP team selects âApproved for Filingâ from Decision action.
Page 308
IPfolio User Guide
Status When
Trademark(s) Filed Related trademark is filed.
Trademark(s) Registered Related trademark is registered.
Closed IP team selects âNot Availableâ from Decision action.
Note:
Status fields are important as they:
âª indicate the stage the record is in.
âª determine actions team members need to take.
âª are used to filter records in List Views and Reports.
âª are used to trigger workflows and other automated processes.
âª can affect who can edit records.
Status fields are updated by IPfolio. Do not update the status fields manually.
Fixing Proposed Marks Auto-Numbering Issues
Multiple proposed marks, created from one Trademark Search Request, are auto-numbered. Sometimes, an error
may occur with the auto-numbering.
If, when creating a Proposed Mark from a Trademark Search Request, auto-numbering doesnât function for a newly
created Proposed Mark, follow the procedure below.
Figure 40. Auto-numbering issue with proposed marks
1. Go to the Object Settings tab of the Navigation Bar and open the Proposed_Mark record.
2. Manually set the Current Value field of the Proposed_Mark record to match the last properly numbered 
Proposed Mark ID (e.g., if the last Proposed Mark ID = âPM-00024â, as on the screenshot above, set
Current Value to â24â).
3. Create a new Proposed Mark from the TSR â the auto-numbering will work correctly going forwards.
Creating Tasks
You can manually create tasks related to Trademark Search Requests to track common work items.
Page 309
| 6 - Trademark Lifecycle
1. Open the required trademark search request.
2. Click New Task button in the Activity section.
3. Enter the required values:
Option Description
Subject Purpose of task
Due date Deadline for completing task
Status Status of task
Assigned to Person responsible for completing the task
Priority Level of priority
4. Click Save.
Result: When a task related to a Trademark Search Request is created, the Title field on the task list view 
is populated with the Proposed Mark value.
Setting the Law Firm Field as Optional or Mandatory for New Trademarks
Law Firm can be defined as optional or mandatory field. This is important for creating new Trademarks.
To make Law Firm a mandatory field when creating a new Trademark:
1. Go to Setup> Object Manager> Trademark.
2. Select Field Sets.
3. Select New Trademark page additional fields.
4. Click the wrench next to Law Firm.
5. Tick the checkbox Required.
6. Click Save.
Page 310
IPfolio User Guide
Law Firm is now a mandatory field that needs to be populated when creating a new Trademark. If the field should be
reset to optional, please follow the steps above and deselect the checkbox Required.
Trademarks
When creating a trademark record from a trademark search request record, IPfolio copies several fields to the new
trademark record.
As in other IPfolio objects, the topmost section typically captures key fields such as the Mark Name, Type of Mark, 
Country, and Status, and the actual mark is rendered in a section below.
Note: Use the âSkip copy same name fieldsâ field set to define the fields to be skipped during the automatic
copying of field values from one object to another. The values of the fields specified in this field set will not
copy over when creating a Trademark from a Trademark Search Request or from a Trademark Family.
The Classes & Goods section deserves special attention: while all Classes and Goods/Services are available as text
fields for a quick overview as well as for reporting purposes, they are managed in a separate table (related list) on
the record. Please use only this table for adding or editing Classes and Goods/Services.
Trademark Status
Trademark records have two status fields: Status (High-Level) and Status (Prosecution).
Table: Trademark Status Fields
Status Description
Status 
(High-Level)
Tracks trademarks in simple, broad terms.
Status 
(Prosecution)
Tracks trademarks in greater detail. Analogous to âstatus with the PTOâ.
You can control and customize the logic of setting Status (Prosecution) on Trademark records. For
details please see Customizing Status (Prosecution) Logic on Trademarks (on page 312).
Note:
Status fields are important as they:
âª indicate the stage the record is in.
âª determine actions team members need to take.
âª are used to filter records in List Views and Reports.
âª are used to trigger workflows and other automated processes.
âª can affect who can edit records.
Status fields are updated by IPfolio. Do not update the status fields manually.

Status (High-Level)
Status (Prosecution)
Page 311
| 6 - Trademark Lifecycle
Customizing Status (Prosecution) Logic on Trademarks
You can control and customize the logic of setting Status (Prosecution) on Trademark records.
1. Open Admin Panel using App Launcher.
2. Go Admin Panel > General Settings > Miscellaneous> Status (Prosecution) Configuration.
3. Fill in the Status (Prosecution) Logic - TM field with the necessary formula.
4. Activate Enable Status (Prosecution) Logic - TM.
Next time you update a Trademark record, its Status (Prosecution) will be recalculated in accordance with the 
formula you introduced in Status (Prosecution) Logic - TM.
Adding Classes and Goods
You can add either international or local descriptions of goods and services to trademark records.
As well as trademark records, the Classes & Goods table is also available on such objects as:
Page 312
IPfolio User Guide
âª Trademark Search Request. If you specify classes and goods/services at that stage already, they will
automatically be copied down from the TSRs to trademark records upon creation. If you are using several
different versions of class codes based, e.g., on different business units, you can also select a specific class code
edition number from the dropdown list.
âª Conflict. It is useful if you would like to track Classes & Goods both for internal trademarks and third party
trademarks - e.g., the ones infringing on the rights of your trademarks.
1. Go to the Classes & Goods table (as shown in the Screenshot below) on the Details 
tab.
2. Click New.
3. Select the desired Class Code to be added to the trademark from the list in the Class Definition field.
More info: The corresponding Goods/Services Description and Class Type ('Nice (Trademarks,
International)' or 'Local') will be filled automatically. The Goods/Services Description value is taken from
the Class Description (long) field of the Class Definition record.
4. Add some Notes, if desired.
5. Click Save. The new class and/or goods are added to the table, and the text fields further above are
updated accordingly.
Additional sections include further details like bibliographic data, related/family information, and the Category Tree
(on page 165). All the standard IPfolio lists and sections such as Documents, Tasks/Activities, Actions, Renewals, and
links to other objects like Conflicts and Contracts, are available as you scroll further down on the page.
Trademark Family
Similar to the patent family, the Trademark Family largely plays its role in the background. Most users rarely make
updates at the family level, since all prosecution, renewals, opposition, and other activities tend to happen at the
level of an individual trademark.
IPfolio sets the trademark family Status as follows:
1. If at least one family member is In Force, the family is âIn Forceâ
2. Else if at least one member is Pending, the family is âPendingâ
3. Else if at least one member is Expiring, the family is âExpiringâ
4. Else if all family members are Not Filed, the Family is âNot Filedâ
5. Else if all members are either Not Filed or Finally Lapsed, the Family is âFinally Lapsedâ
6. Else if all members are either Not Filed or Lapsed or Finally Lapsed, the family is âLapsedâ
7. Else if all members are either Not Filed or Closed, the family is âClosedâ
8. Else if all members are either Not Filed or Sold, the family is âSoldâ
9. Else the family is âClosedâ
The trademark family is particularly useful for reporting. Use it for reports at the mark or brand level, rather than
the jurisdictional level.
Note: When creating a Trademark/Trademark Family from a Trademark Search Request, the system copies
over the values of such fields as Mark Name, In-House Counsel and Law Firm. If an intermediate Trademark
record, created using the Approve for Filing/Create Trademark buttons, holds values other than null 
for these fields, they get copied over from Trademark to Trademark Family. Otherwise, the values from
Trademark Search Request get copied over to the Trademark Family record.
Page 313
| 6 - Trademark Lifecycle
Tip:
If you are not using the IP Portal and are not managing a trademark search process, you may find only
limited value in the Trademark Search Request object. In this case, you can entirely skip that object. Just
create a Trademark Family record whenever you have made a filing decision, enter the Mark Name as the
Family Name, and create the first trademark to be filed from there using the Create Trademark button on 
the Trademark Family object.
âª If 'EM - European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO)'
is selected as a Country, Procedure will be automatically set to 
EUIPO.
âª If the Trademark Family has some Categories selected, they will be copied down to the newly created
Trademark.
âª When a Trademark is created from a Trademark Family, the value of the Trademark Family's Search 
Request ID field is copied to the Trademark's Trademark Search Request field. (Unless Search Request 
ID is included in the âSkip copy same name fieldsâ field set â in this case, it's not copied over.)
Third Party Trademarks
For managing third party trademarks that you may require in the context of trademark watches, oppositions, and
litigation, a separate Third Party Trademark object is available.
This object allows you to manage Third Party bibliographical data, attach documents, manage tasks, and relate those
records to Conflicts, Contracts, and more.
On the Third Party Trademarks tab, simply click New to create a new record.
Trademark Foreign Filing Process
It is common to file a mark in your home country first, then file foreign applications later. IPfolio makes creating
foreign filing records easier with a centralized process that copies key values to the new trademark records.
Create Trademarks
Clicking the Create Trademarks action from an existing (âsourceâ) trademark:
âª Creates one or more trademark foreign filing records.
âª Copies key fields from the source trademark to the new trademark records.
âª Copies Classes & Goods from the source trademark to the new trademark records and gives you the option to
add more / remove existing ones.
âª Provides additional options, like the ability to create a new trademark family during record creation.
Page 314
IPfolio User Guide
How it works
âª Click Create Trademarks on your home country (or âsourceâ) trademark.
âª An onscreen form appears, pre-populated with data from the current trademark.
âª Complete the form and click Create.
âª Behind the scenes, we save your form responses to a âTM Filing Instructionâ record.
âª We then use the TM Filing Instruction record to create the individual foreign filing trademark records.
Note: Reviewing the saved TM Filing Instruction records later can be helpful. They provide helpful context
about the trademarks created from them.
Creating Foreign Filings
You can create foreign filings directly from an existing trademark record, by clicking Create Trademarks.
1. Open the required source trademark record.
2. Click Create Trademarks.
Result: An onscreen Foreign Filings form appears, pre-populated with data from the current trademark.
The fields shown on the form are copied from the source trademark to the new foreign filing records.
3. Select the required Options.
Option Description
Create New Family
Conceptually, a trademark âfamilyâ groups related trademarks together. 
Some customers use families to group records by mark, others use them to
group records by brand. Either way, trademark families help you organize
your trademark records.
When creating foreign filing records, ideally the trademark family and the 
home country trademark already exist, and you are creating foreign filings
from the home country trademark. This is true when you:
âª Create a trademark family first, then use Create Trademark (on the family record) to create the first trademark record.
âª Use Create Trademark from a Trademark Search Request. This creates a 
trademark, but also creates a trademark family in the background.
If you donât yet have a trademark family, the Create New Family option will 
create a new trademark family and add the new trademark records to it.
Claim Priority
Earliest Priority Filing ID is only shown if Claim Priority is checked.
Page 315
| 6 - Trademark Lifecycle
Option Description
âª If the Source Trademark IDâs Earliest Priority Filing ID is blank, it is prepopulated with the Source Trademark ID.
âª Otherwise, it is populated with the Source Trademark IDâs Earliest Priority Filing ID.
Is Subsequent Designation
Is Subsequent Designation is used to add subsequent designations to the 
existing WO Trademark. It is a default selection when Registration Date is 
filled in.
Is Designation Is Designation is used to add countries to the existing WO Trademark without claiming subsequent designation. It is a default selection when Registration Date is not filled in.
Create New WO Trademark
Create New WO Trademark is used to create a new WO Trademark.
4. Select the required Countries.
More info: 
âNational Filing Countriesâ show all active Country object records. âWIPO Filing Countriesâ show all the
member countries within the Country Group object whose Country Group ID=Madrid Protocol.
âª If the Source Trademark IDâs Country Code is WO, the Base Trademark ID is pre-populated with the
formerâs Base Trademark ID.
âª Otherwise, it defaults to the Source Trademark ID.
For National Filing Countries Procedure picklist defaults to National. When leaving the Procedure at 
National, Trademarks created for every National Filing Country selected get Procedure = National. If 
a different value is selected for Procedure, all Trademarks created for every National Filing Country
selected get that respective Procedure value.
5. Select the required Classes & Goods.
More info: 
Classes & Goods are pre-populated with the Classes & Goods of the Base Trademark, and (when Claim 
Priority in Options is selected and Earliest Priority Filing ID has a value), of the Priority Trademark. If
Claim Priority is selected and Earliest Priority Filing ID is blank, Classes & Goods are copied down from 
the Base Trademark. The âCreated Fromâ column shows the source of the listing.
You can add class codes manually, too. Click Add Class Code and select a class code from the picklist. Class 
Type is defaulted to 'Nice (Trademarks, International)' and filters the Class Code values accordingly.
Please note that to proceed, you cannot leave Class Code empty â make sure to select a value and have it
filled.
Page 316
IPfolio User Guide
If you are using several different versions of class codes based, e.g., on different business units, you can
also select a specific class code edition number from the dropdown list. The edition numbers are populated 
from the Edition Number field of the Class Definition object.
Goods/Services Description is pre-populated from the Class Description (long) field of the Class 
Definition record.
You can delete added classes for:
âª Specific jurisdictions using the Applicable Countries column.
âª All jurisdictions using the Delete button in the Action column.
6. Complete the form and click Create.
Clicking Create creates a TM Filing Instructions record and triggers the creation of Trademarks.
âª To be able to proceed with creating a TM Filing Instruction, at least one country should be selected.
âª If at least one International Filing Country is selected and Is Subsequent Designation is not checked, a WO
Trademark is created.
âª When creating National Trademark records: if Single Class Trademarks (Nat. Filings) is checked on the related
Country record, multiple single-class records are created, otherwise one multi-class record is created.
âª When creating International Trademark records: if Single Class Trademarks (WIPO Filings) is checked on the
related Country record, multiple single-class records are created, otherwise one multi-class record is created.
âª Classes & Goods with Created From = Priority Trademark and populated Earliest Priority Filing ID are copied 
from the Priority Trademark to National Trademarks.
âª Classes & Goods with Created From = Priority Trademark and empty Earliest Priority Filing ID are copied from 
the Base Trademark to National Trademarks.
âª Classes & Goods with Created From = Base Trademark are copied to all the newly created Trademarks. If Claim 
Priority is checked, Classes & Goods are propagated to national filings from the Priority Trademark.
âª Classes & Goods with Created From = Manually are copied to National Trademarks.
âª Categorizations are copied from parent to child Trademarks in accordance with the following logic:
Base Trademark Null Base Trademark Not Null
Priority Trademark Null Copy Categorizations from Source Trademark to National 
Trademarks, International Trademarks, WO
Copy Categorizations from Source to National Trademarks Copy Categorizations from Base Trademark to International Trademarks, WO
Priority Trademark Not Null Copy Categorizations from Source Trademark to International Trademarks, WO Copy Categorizations from Priority Trademark to National Trademarks
Copy Categorizations from Priority Trademark to National Trademarks Copy Categorizations from Base 
Trademark to International Trademarks, WO

| 6 - Trademark Lifecycle
Foreign Filings Form Customization
The fields on the Foreign Filings form are customizable.
Figure 41. Foreign Filings Form
The Trademark object has two âfield setsâ that control the fields shown on the form.
âª The first group of fields are read-only and defined by the Copy when creating child records field set.
âª The second group of fields are editable and defined by the Child Record Creation Additional Fields field set.
A field set is a grouping of fields. They make it possible for non-developers to customize a process. In this case,
IPfolio copies fields from the source trademark to the new trademark records, but field sets let you customize which
fields are copied. For more information, see Field Sets.
For the Record Image to be copied from the base Trademark to child records created with the Create Trademarks
button, the Preview Image or Image Attachment Id fields should be included in the Copy when creating child
records field set.
Instant Processing of TM Filing Instructions
TM Filing Instructions are automatically processed by default.
The checkbox Instantly Process TM Filing Instructions in the Admin panel under General Settings > Miscellaneous 
manages the automatic handling of TM Filing Instructions. This setting is enabled by default.
When enabled, creating a new TM Filing Instruction via Create Trademarks on a Trademark will automatically
update the following fields in the object TM Filing Instruction:
âª Status: Changes to Instruction Acknowledged.
âª Instruction Validation Date: Set to the current date.
âª Instructions Validated: Changes to true.
Page 318
IPfolio User Guide
If the checkbox is disabled:
âª Status: Set to New Filing Instructions.
âª Instruction Validation Date: Remains empty.
âª Instructions Validated: Set to false.
Converting/Transforming Trademarks
If an EU trademark ceases to exist, it can be converted into trademarks that are valid in certain Member States.
Conversion is also useful when it comes to tackling potential issues with the EUTMâs unitary character.
You can create âconverted/transformedâ national Trademark records from Trademarks of such jurisdictions as EM 
(European Union Trademarks, often abbreviated as âEUTMsâ) and WO (International Trademark Registrations,
often abbreviated as âIRsâ) that inherit certain field values from the source Trademark.
For more details and circumstances, under which conversion/transformation is possible, please see the EUIPOand 
WIPOwebsites.
1. Click Convert/
Transform.
2. Select the country you would like to convert/transform the trademark to and click Next.
3. On the next screen Country/Jurisdiction, Procedure and Trademark ID are auto-populated. If necessary,
fill in the additional fields (defaulted to Law Firm and Law Firm Reference, can be edited in the 
Conversion/Transformation Additional Fields field set).
4. Click Create.
Upon creation of a new Trademark, the values of the fields specified in the Copy when creating child records field 
set are copied over to it from the source Trademark.
The lookup field Converted/Transformed from TM ID located on the Details page (Related Marks section) of the 
newly created Trademark displays the ID of the source Trademark.

CompuMark Sync
CompuMark Sync reconciles data from your IPfolio trademark and third party trademark records with CompuMark
data from 186 trademark databases.
CompuMark Sync compares data from IPfolio records with data from matching CompuMark records, autopopulates missing values, and reconciles data differences.
IPfolio populates:
âª Key bibliographic dates and numbers.
âª Classes.
âª Goods & Services.
âª Original Applicant and Registered Owner.
âª Mark image.
CompuMark Sync uses IPfolio Data Audits (on page 364), making it easy to âAcceptâ or âDiscardâ proposed
changes.
CompuMark Trademark Databases
CompuMark includes data from 186 trademark databases. Our database includes International Register, EU
nationals, EU trademarks, European microstates, Switzerland, and Norway.
Data Integrity is of great importance to CompuMark, as these statistics demonstrate:
Page 320
IPfolio User Guide
âª 40% of records enhanced to improve precision
âª 10% of USPTO records corrected on average
âª 1.1% of EUIPO records corrected on average
Note: Generally, CompuMark removes inactive trademarks after 3 years, pending applications and renewals
under a new number â after 2 years. This applies to most of the major trademark registers, but there are
exceptions for some countries. Besides, please bear in mind that some "older"trademarks that are still
under review might also appear in the search results.
Included Fields
CompuMark includes numerous bibliographic fields, such as applicant, registered owner, and application date/
number.

âª Please bear in mind that for some of the above-mentioned fields the data retrieval is jurisdictiondependent (e.g., Cancelled/Abandoned Date is currently not retrieved by CompuMark for Australia,
Publication Date - for New Zealand, etc.). Those fields should be controlled and filled in manually.
âª If you would like to have an indication when your trademark needs to be renewed/expires, we
recommend that you include all of the following three fields: Renewal Date (CompuMark), Next
Renewal Date (CompuMark) and Expiry Date (CompuMark). Please note that these dates are not 
calculated by the system but retrieved from PTO records, so the data availability depends on whether
the date is published by a local trademark office.
Derived Fields
During updates, we look up related IPfolio records and populate the following fields:
IPfolio Field Name API Name
Base Trademark ID IPfolio__Base_Trademark_ID__c
Earliest Priority Filing ID IPfolio__Earliest_Priority_Filing_ID__c
Additionally, our business logic may update other trademark fields, including:
IPfolio Field Name API Name
Status (High-Level) IPfolio__IP_Right_Status__c
Status (Prosecution) IPfolio__Prosecution_Status__c
Applicants
The CompuMark API includes Applicant data. We use this to populate the Original Applicant and Registered 
Owner fields in IPfolio.
Details
IPfolio trademark records include two fields, Original Applicant and Registered Owner, used to identify the 
Applicant and Registered Owner respectively. Original Applicant and Registered Owner are both âParty lookupâ
fields. (You populate them by selecting a party record.)
While itâs possible to have multiple applicants, itâs uncommon. We use the first applicant if multiple applicants are
found.
CompuMark Sync uses âApplicantâ data from the CompuMark API to populate Original Applicant and Registered 
Owner using the following logic.
For Original Applicant and Registered Owner:
âª If the field is blank, and we find an existing party that matches the CompuMark Applicant, we populate the field
with the matching party.
âª If the field is blank, and we do not find an existing party that matches the CompuMark Applicant, we create a
party and populate the field with the party.
âª If the field has a value, and we find an existing party that matches the CompuMark Applicant, we create a Data
Audit.
âª If the field has a value, and we do not find an existing party that matches the CompuMark Applicant, we create a
party and a Data Audit.
Page 322
IPfolio User Guide
âª If the field is included in the 'Always require Sync Log validation' field set, a new party is not created until a
Data Audit is accepted. If a Data Audit has been accepted, but a party with the suggested name already exists, a
duplicate will not be created.
Note: CompuMark data includes applicantName and applicantNameNative fields, with the latter being 
an untranslated version of applicantName. If applicantName is missing, we use applicantNameNative
instead.
Classes & Goods
CompuMark sync automatically adds Classes & Goods records in CompuMark that are missing from IPfolio.
In addition, CompuMark sync creates data audits to delete Classes & Goods records in IPfolio but not in 
CompuMark data, and creates data audits to reconcile differences in the Goods/Services Description value.
Mark Image
CompuMark Sync retrieves the mark image from CompuMark, adds the image to the Documents section of the
current record, and then sets the image as the ârecord imageâ, to display it prominently on the current record (If the
record image is not already set.).
Figure 42. CompuMark Sync Mark Image
IPfolio uses the CompuMark /images API endpoint to retrieve trademark images.
The API returns a single image for most trademarks. However, there are exceptions, such as designs which often
have multiple images, and some UK edge cases which include multiple image.
When multiple images are found, IPfolio downloads all images to Documents, and sets the first found as the ârecord 
imageâ (If the record image is not already set).
The image files have a dpi of 300, and are usually under 1 Mb.
IPfolio downloads the mark image initially but does not check for updates thereafter.
Sync Details
Before IPfolio records can be populated with CompuMark data, we need to find the right external record by
matching it with the internal record, using different Trademark fields.
Initial Match
For the initial match, the matching logic is as follows (we try each combination in order):
Page 323
| 6 - Trademark Lifecycle
1. Try Filing Date / Application Number (as-is)
2. Try Filing Date / Application Number (special characters removed)
3. Try Filing Date / Application Number (special characters and leading zeros removed)
4. Try Registration Date / Registration Number (as-is)
5. Try Registration Date / Registration Number (special characters removed)
Subsequent Matches
âª We add a CompuMark Id to the trademark record after a successful match.
âª We use the CompuMark Id (and not the match logic above) for all subsequent matches.
Note:
Our code prevents most âmismatchesâ. To fix a mismatched record, start by clearing the CompuMark Id
manually.
You can use the Searching Application and Registration Numbers table as a reference for the CompuMark 
jurisdictional search criteria (including searchable Application and Registration Number formats).
If an incoming Filing Date differs from the IPfolio Filing Date, a Data Audit will suggest the incoming date to 
the user. If the user accepts the Data Audit, the sync will re-run, and the record will be matched.
Match Trademarks via IP One Data
CompuMark syncing and matching probability can also be improved by applying the IP One Data matching
algorithm for retrieving CompuMark IDs. Please get in touch with your Administrator in order to enable the option
Match Trademarks via IP One.
Manual Sync
To sync an individual record, use the CompuMark Sync button on the trademark record. This works the same as it
does with other data feed integrations (IP ONE, IPsync, etc.)
Daily Sync
IPfolio manages daily syncs automatically.
âª CompuMark remembers synced records for the current org.
âª CompuMark sends each org a list of updated records.
âª Receiving a list of records triggers a bulk update of those records in IPfolio.
Mark Image
IPfolio downloads the mark image initially but does not check for updates thereafter.
International Designations
When a sync is performed on a child trademark whose parent's Country Code = WO, to avoid linking International
Designations to local jurisdiction details based on Application/Registration Numbers that might match local
jurisdictions, the following logic is in place:
âª If there is a value in the CompuMark ID field on the parent WO trademark, it is used to perform a sync on the
child record.
âª If CompuMark ID on the parent WO record is blank, WO is used instead of the childâs Country Code.

Watched Trademarks
IPfolio retrieves existing trademarks and syncs watch orders with CompuMark. The Watched Trademark field is 
populated with the name of the watched trademark. If no existing trademark is found, the watch order is still linked
to the Watched Trademark field, allowing for manual linking with Trademarks/Trademark Families later.
Data Migration
When initiating the CompuMark Trademark Watch, 100 days of backdated watch results from the integration date
are migrated. This is a CompuMark standard.
If you wish to migrate more than the standard 100 days of backdated data, please contact the implementation team
before setting up the CompuMark Trademark Watch integration.
Requirements
The integration is designed for IPfolio trademark customers who use CompuMark trademark watch products.
CompuMark Requirements
The IPfolio integration requires an active CompuMark account.
âª If you can create and view CompuMark trademark watches in SERION manually, we can configure the
integration.
âª If you arenât a CompuMark customer or otherwise canât create and view watches in SERION, please contact
CompuMark first.
IPfolio Requirements
Once your CompuMark account is ready, we do additional configuration in IPfolio. For example:
âª We connect IPfolio to your CompuMark account.
âª We adjust Trademark and Trademark Family page layouts, and more.

Ordering a Trademark Watch
Our trademark watch integration lets you create, edit, and view trademark watches directly from IPfolio trademark
and trademark family records.
Page 326
IPfolio User Guide
Important: Please contact CompuMark if you inadvertently submit the watch order form or send conflicting
requests.
1. Navigate to a trademark or trademark family record.
More info: The watch is based on the mark name. Since the mark name is the same on the trademark
family record and all trademark records in the family, you can create a watch from any record in the family.
Watches you create appear on all records in the family.
2. Click Order Watch.
3. In the Order Details window, enter the required values:
a. Select the required CompuMark Trademark Watch Product (on page 329).
b. Specify the trademark and International Classes. (These are auto-populated by default.)
c. Indicate how to manage Identicaltrademarks in other classes.
d. Click Next.
4. In the Additional info window:
a. Specify the watch order Start date.
b. Enter more information or instructions to CompuMark in the Additional Instructions box.
c. Click Next.
5. In the Select countries/Regions/Registers window, select the jurisdictions where CompuMark should
watch, and then click Next.
â¦ Use the Simplified view to select by region.
â¦ Use the Detailed view for greater control of country selections.
6. In the Summary, review the values to ensure accuracy (you can expand Countries to review selected
countries.) When you have finished, click Submit.
Watch Order records appear in the Watch Orders related list on all trademarks in the family. Each time you
submit or resubmit a watch order, IPfolio creates an Email with the watch order details. This Email is then sent to
CompuMark, In-House Counsel (or to the record owner if the In-House Counsel is empty), the currently logged
in user, and the organization's own Email address. The Email is also added to the Documents section of the watch 
order record.
You can edit an existing watch order in SERION.

| 6 - Trademark Lifecycle
Reviewing Watch Results
With the IPfolio integration, you continue to use the CompuMark online platform to review trademark watch
results.
Features:
âª Access powerful filtering and sorting tools, plus POCA similarity scoring.
âª Prioritize actions with the innovative Opposition Dashboard, showing the days to opposition for each mark
cited.
âª Export and email key findings to outside counsel and share results with colleagues using online collaboration
tools.
1. Navigate to SERION and select Watch Results from the Watch tab.
More info: You can go to SERION directly, or click the link in SERION email notifications.
2. Review watch results. SERION displays all watch results in a common list.
More info: You can sort and filter the list as needed. For example, to see watch results grouped by the
CompuMark Trademark Watch product that produced them, filter or sort on the âProductâ column.
3. Set the Status of individual watch result records.
More info: By default, when you set the Status of a SERION watch result to Opposition, IPfolio creates a 
conflict record and a third party trademark record, and auto-populates the third party trademark.
Defining SERION Statuses that Trigger Record Creation
You can change which SERION watch result statuses trigger IPfolio record creation.
By default, the integration automatically creates IPfolio Conflict and Third Party Trademark records when you set
the Status of a SERION watch result to âOppositionâ.
You can change this default behavior, by customizing the Status picklist values in SERION (see the SERION 
documentation for details), and by changing which SERION watch result statuses trigger IPfolio record creation
(described below).
1. Open the Admin panel in IPfolio.
2. Select CompuMark from the Data Feed tab (Admin Panel > Data Feed > CompuMark).
3. Enter the SERION status values that should trigger IPfolio record creation in SERION Statuses for Watch
Retrieval.
Page 328
IPfolio User Guide
IPfolio Records Created from Watches
The integration monitors SERION and creates IPfolio records when you set the Status of a SERION watch result to 
Opposition (or another status that you have defined).
The integration automatically creates an IPfolio Conflict (on page 356) record.
In addition, the integration automatically creates an IPfolio Third Party Trademark record. IPfolio:
âª Creates a Third Party Trademark record.
âª Populates the newly created Third Party Trademark record using CompuMark Sync (on page 320).
âª Auto-populates the Opposition Deadline field on the newly created Third Party Trademark record using the
Watch Order Sync.
âª Relates the record to the corresponding Conflict record.
IPfolio Watch Order Record
IPfolio creates Conflict and Third Party Trademark records for specified watch results regardless of how you
ordered the watch. However, the integration wonât create the IPfolio records without a matching watch order 
record (on page 326). It looks for a matching watch order record. If it canât find one, it creates one.
âª If you created the watch request in IPfolio, the IPfolio watch order record already exists.
âª If you created the watch request in SERION, the IPfolio watch order record doesnât exist, so it creates one.
Note: A SERION watch result and IPfolio watch order match when the SERION Watched value equals the 
IPfolio Mark Name value. We âconnectâ the records by copying the SERION CompuMark Order Id value 
into the IPfolio Watch Order CompuMark Order Number field.

Documents
IPsync downloads files to the Documents section of the current record. We process downloaded .pdf files to make
them text searchable in IPfolio.
IPsync downloads available prosecution documents and saves them in a folder called âOfficial Registerâ.
Sync Details
IPsync does not get data from PTOs directly. Instead, we use a data provider whose primary focus is collecting and
updating data from various jurisdictions.
Page 336
IPfolio User Guide
Daily Checks
Our provider checks PTO records daily, looking for status updates that indicate meaningful changes have occurred.
They update their records accordingly. IPsync focuses on reconciling (or âsyncingâ) data in your IPfolio records with
the normalized data supplied by our provider.
Note: Our data provider scrapes data from various PTOs. IPsync synchronizes your IPfolio data with data
from our provider, looking for discrepancies.
Understanding this separation is helpful, especially when trying to understand when updates appear in IPfolio. For
example:
It is accurate to say IPsync compares IPfolio records with our providerâs records daily. But it also helps to remember:
âª The data needs to be available from the PTO.
âª Our provider needs time to get the updates.
âª We need time to sync your records with data from our provider.
Many updates docketed at the PTO are available in IPfolio the following day. Applications filed late in the day are
likely processed by the PTO the following day, and appear in IPfolio the day after that.
A good rule of thumb is that updates docketed at the PTO are generally available in IPfolio 2-3 days after you see
them in Patent Center Private View (former Private PAIR).
Important: Patents and Trademarks in the Closed, Lapsed, or Sold (+ Finally Lapsed for Patents) status are
not synced, and their statuses don't get updated upon IPsync data retrieval.
Advanced Scraper
As stated above, most updates are available 2-3 days after they appear in Patent Center Private View. However,
there are exceptions.
A small subset of actions may take considerably longer, the most notable example being a Response to Office Action. 
These may take 7-10 days (or longer) due to how they are processed by the USPTO.
Our provider offers an advanced scraping option that reduces the wait for these actions. There is an additional fee
since this requires them to scrape all records every day (as opposed to those the PTO marks as updated.) There are
three options (sorted in descending order by cost.)
âª Perform an immediate update of applications every day.
âª In addition to the standard daily update service, perform an immediate update of pending applications every 3
calendar days.
âª In addition to the standard daily update service, perform an immediate update of pending applications every 7
calendar days.
Note: Advanced Scraping is required for WO / CN sync since there is no monitored date to be used.
Discrepancy Reconciliation
IPsync primarily uses the Application Number to match IPfolio records with PTO records.
If no Application Number is found in an IPfolio record, the system tries to populate it with the USPTO value, based
on matching Attorney Docket Number and Law Firm Reference numbers in the respective records.
Page 337
| 6 - Trademark Lifecycle
Bibliographic fields are handled as follows:
âª If your value and the PTO value are the same, no action is taken.
âª If your field is empty, and the PTO has a value, we add the PTO value to your record.
âª If your value and the PTO value differ, we do not change your record. Instead, we create a Data Audit entry 
noting the difference.
See Data Audits (on page 364) for details.
Note: When the system tries to create new Data Audit Logs related to a record whose Owner is inactive,
it assigns any other System Administrator of the org, whose email does not contain @ipfolio or 
@clarivate, as owner of these new Data Audit Logs, and the sync is successfully completed.

Chapter 7. Design Lifecycle
With IPfolio you can create, manage and track your designs throughout their entire lifecycle.
The four main record types that let you manage your designs are as follows:
âª Design Family â a master record for managing designs. You must have a Design Family before you can create
Industrial Designs or Design Rights.
âª Industrial Design â a record that contains different views associated with the design.
âª Design Right â a record representing a design application you file, which is then legally protected in a specific
jurisdiction. Depending on the Application Type, it can be associated with one or several Industrial Designs.
âª Multiple Design Application â a record grouping several Design Rights filed as part of a multiple application.
Single and Multiple Applications
Some jurisdictions allow multiple design applications while others do not.
When you create Design Rights in IPfolio, you can select one of the three Application Types:
âª Single per Design â a Design Right is created for just one Industrial Design.
âª Single with Selected Designs â a Design Right is associated with several Industrial Designs. You can pick
this option if designs related to the same product are very similar and the differences between them are
insignificant. In this case, a Design Right with all the Industrial Designs linked to it is handled as one application
(this also applies to renewals, for example). If later on a decision is taken that Industrial Designs are still not that
close and should be handled separately, a Design Right record can be split into more Design Rights/applications.
âª Multiple â several Design Rights, each containing one Industrial Design, are grouped by a Multiple Design
Application record to be filed together, in one multiple design application. Later on, when it comes to renewing
the designs, a decision on each Design Right can be taken separately. As mentioned above, multiple applications
are only legally allowed in certain countries.
Design Families
Currently your design journey starts with creating a Design Family.
A Design Family groups Design Right and Industrial Design records together and stores information about the 
family.
It offers an overview of the associated Industrial Designs and Design Rights and provides you with the possibility to
create and manage Industrial Design and Design Right records.
Creating a Design Family
To be able to create and further manage Industrial Designs and Design Rights, please create a Design Family first.

Design Family Status
A Design Family is a collection of Design Rights, each with its own status. The logic used to assign a status to the 
family is open to interpretation.
IPfolio sets Family Status as follows:
âª If at least one family member is In Force, the family is In Force.
âª If at least one family member is Pending, the family is Pending.
âª If all family members are Not Filed, the family is Not Filed.
âª If all family members are Lapsed, the family is Lapsed.
âª If all family members are Closed, the family is Closed.
âª If all family members are Sold, the family is Sold.
âª If the family members are a mix of at least two of these: Not Filed, Lapsed, Closed, or Sold, the family is Closed.
Industrial Designs
Industrial Design records contain images associated with your design application.
Industrial Designs should be created from Design Families and can be linked to Design Rights, allowing you to
visualize applications which include one or several Industrial Designs.
Creating Industrial Designs from a Design Family
You can create Industrial Design records from a Design Family.
1. Open the Industrial Designs tab of a Design Family record.
2. Click Add Industrial Design.
3. Fill in the Product Indication field with the indication of the exact product (or its part) to which the design
applies â e.g., chair; shoe; motif for textiles; lipstick core, etc.
4. Click Confirm.
5. In the Images section click Upload Files.
Page 341
| 7 - Design Lifecycle
6. Select the images you need to upload and click Open.
7. Once the images are uploaded, click Done. The uploaded images will be ordered alphabetically sby their
file names.
More info: If you edit the Industrial Design later on and add more images, they will be added after the
already existing ones and ordered alphabetically among themselves.
8. In the Designers section select the designer(s) you would like to add from the dropdown in the Add 
Designers search field.
More info: You can only select a designer (a Party) thatâs already linked to the Designer (Design Family)
record on the Design Family related to the current Industrial Design.
9. If there are multiple designers involved, fill in/edit the Contribution Share (%) field indicating the 
contribution share of a particular designer.
10. Click Confirm.
You have created an Industrial Design record and can further use it when creating a Design Right. The Documents 
tab displays the images you have uploaded.
Managing Industrial Designs
You can manage (edit or delete) Industrial Designs both within a Design Family and on the Industrial Designs list
view page.
Managing Industrial Designs within a Design Family
You can manage your Industrial Designs right within the Design Family they are related to.
1. Open the Industrial Designs tab of a Design Family record.
2. Click the down arrow next to the Industrial Design you would like to manage and select the necessary
option â edit or delete the record. You can also reorder Industrial Designs within a Design Family using the
drag-and-drop dots icon.

view page only for further managing them.
Design Rights
Use Design Right records to file and manage your design applications.
Creating a Design Right from a Design Family
Currently, you can only create a Design Right from a Design Family.
Please create Industrial Designs you would like to include in your application before creating Design Rights.
1. Open the required Design Family.
2. Click Create Design Rights.
â¦ If it is the first Design Right created from this Design Family, go to Step 3 below.
â¦ If it is not the first Design Right created from this Design Family, you can establish the child-parent
relation for the newly created Design Right record with a Design Right that already exists within the
same family - e.g., reference an international design application (parent) for a national design right 
(child). For this, enter the corresponding ParentID and Relationship to Parent in the window that 
opens and click Next.
Page 343
| 7 - Design Lifecycle
The Design Rights suggested as parents in the dropdown list will be filtered to those related to the 
current family.
â¦ If you don't want to establish any child-parent relation for the newly created record, simply leave the
fields blank and click Next.
3. Add Country(or countries) you would like to file in. They will then be displayed in the Filing Countries 
column of the table below.
4. In the filing table, against each country you have added, select Application Type:
â¦ Single per Design - for single design applications corresponding to just one Industrial Design.
â¦ Single with Selected Designs - for single design applications that contain several Industrial Designs.
â¦ Multiple - for multiple design applications, applicable only for the countries with the respective
legislation.
More info: 
If the Multiple Design Application checkbox field is enabled on the selected Country, the Application 
Type will be set to Multiple by default. Otherwise, the Application Type default value is Single per Design.
5. Classes are automatically inherited from the Design Family you are creating the Design Right
from. You can edit them by double-clicking in the field or clicking on the pencil icon next to it.
6. Click Next.
Page 344
IPfolio User Guide
7. On the page that opens select the Industrial Designs to be associated with the Design Rights you are
creating by ticking them on the left. If necessary, you can also disable certain filing countries for specific
Industrial Designs by simply clicking on them (they get circled red then).
8. Click Create Design Rights.
âª Your Design Right(s) have been created - you can check and get an overview on the Related tab of the Design 
Family record (Designs section).
âª You can also always get an overview of the status of all Design Rights within a Design Family in a comprehensive
filing table under the Filings tab on Design Family records. The Status Color (on page 656) of each Design Right 
Page 345
| 7 - Design Lifecycle
is also displayed. The Countries are ordered based on the Design Right creation date for this or that country/
jurisdiction.
âª Additionally, you can have an overview of the Design Right records related to the current one by going to
the Design Right's Industrial Designs tab. The sections shown there vary depending on the Design Right's 
Application Type:
âª For Design Rights with Application Type=Single Per Design, a section called Other Application in Design 
Family (Same Country) is available. It displays other Design Rights that belong to the same Design Family
and have the same Country as the current record.
âª For Design Rights with Application Type=Single with Selected Designs, 2 sections are available:
- Other Application in Design Family (Same Country)displaying other Design Rights that belong to the same
Design Family and have the same Country as the current record.
- Split from Design Right (if the current record has been split) - showing the Design Rights that were created 
as a result of splitting the current Design Right.
âª For Design Rights with Application Type=Multiple, a section called Other Design Rights in Multiple Design 
Application is included, listing all Design Rights from the same Multiple Design Application.
Splitting a Design Right (Single with Selected Designs)
You can split a Design Right containing more than one related Industrial Designs into several separate Design Right
records.
If you create a Design Right with the Application Type = Single with Selected Designs and later on decide that you
would like to still split it into several separate Design Rights/applications, here is how you can do it.
Page 346
IPfolio User Guide
1. Open the Industrial Designs tab of the Design Right record.
2. Click Split Design Right.
3. Select Application Type for the new Design Right(s) and Industrial Design(s) that should be included.
4. Click Confirm.
You will get your Design Right split, resulting in as many new Design Right records with as many Industrial Designs
in each, as you have selected.
âª Each Design Right created as a result of splitting will automatically have the Is Splitfrom Parent field activated.
âª Each Design Right created as a result of splitting will automatically have the ParentID field populated with the 
ID of their parent Design Right.
âª The Industrial Designs tab of the parent Design Right will show all the child records created as a result of 
splitting in the Split from Design Right section.
Creating Subsequent Filings from a Multiple Design Application
You can create subsequent filings directly from Multiple Design Application records.
1. Open the Multiple Design Application record.
2. Click Create Child Records.
3. Select the countries you would like to file in using the Add Countries field.
Page 347
| 7 - Design Lifecycle
4. Select the Application Type and Relationship to Parent for the Design Rights to be created for each 
country and click Next.
5. Select the Design Rights you would like to create subsequent filings for by activating the checkboxes to
their left and click Create Child Records.
Child Design Rights will be created as per your selections above, with the following differences, depending on the
Application Type chosen:
âª If in Step 4 you selected Application Type=Single per Design, each new child Design Right will be related to one 
parent on a one-to-one basis.
âª If in Step 4 you selected Application Type=Single with Selected Designs, each new child Design Right will be 
related to as many parent Design Rights as you selected in Step 5.
âª If in Step 4 you selected Application Type=Multiple, a new Multiple Design Application will be created, with 
the new Design Rights included in it and being children of the selected Design Rights from the original Multiple 
Design Application on a one-to-one basis.
Design Right Status
Design Right records have two status fields: Status (High-Level) and Status (Prosecution).
Table: Design Right Status Fields
Status Description
Status 
(High-Level)
Tracks Design Rights in simple, broad terms.
Status 
(Prosecution)
Tracks Design Rights in greater detail. Analogous to the âstatus with the intellectual property officeâ.
You can control and customize the logic of setting Status (Prosecution) on Design Right records. For
details please see Customizing Status (Prosecution) Logic on Design Rights (on page 349).
Note:
Status fields are important as they:
âª indicate the stage the record is in.
âª determine actions team members need to take.
âª are used to filter records in List Views and Reports.
âª are used to trigger workflows and other automated processes.
âª can affect who can edit records.
Status fields are updated by IPfolio. Do not update the status fields manually.
Page 348
IPfolio User Guide
You can also always easily check the Status (High-Level) of your Design Right on the highlight panel at the top each
Design Right's record page. The status path below right below it shows the Status (Prosecution) the Design Right is 
currently in.
Additionally, you can get an overview of the status of all Design Rights within a Design Family in a comprehensive
filing table under the Filings tab on Design Family records. The Status Color (on page 656)of each Design Right is 
also displayed.

Customizing Status (Prosecution) Logic on Design Rights
You can control and customize the logic of setting Status (Prosecution) on Design Right records.
Page 349
| 7 - Design Lifecycle
1. Open Admin Panel using App Launcher.
2. Go Admin Panel > General Settings > Miscellaneous> Status (Prosecution) Configuration.
3. Fill in the Status (Prosecution) Logic - DR field with the necessary formula.
4. Activate Enable Status (Prosecution) Logic - DR.
Next time you update a Design Right record, its Status (Prosecution) will be recalculated in accordance with the 
formula you introduced in Status (Prosecution) Logic - DR.
Managing Design Rights
You can manage (edit or delete) Design Rights both within a Design Family and on the Design Rights list view page.
Managing Design Rights within a Design Family
You can manage your Designs Rights within the Design Family they are related to.
1. Open the Related tab of a Design Family record.
2. Click the down arrow next to the Designs Right you would like to manage and select the necessary option
â edit or delete the record.
Page 350
IPfolio User Guide
Managing Design Rights from the List View
You can also manage (edit or delete) Design Rights from the list view page.
1. Open the Design Rights tab on the Navigation Bar.
2. Click the down arrow icon on the required record and pick the option you need.
More info: 
Important: Please create Design Rights only from a Design Family record, and use the list view 
page only for further managing them..
Managing Images in Design Rights
When creating Design Rights, copies of the Document records of the selected Industrial Designs' images are 
created as separate Document records pointing to the same File.
The Design Right displays these new copies of the images instead of the original Industrial Design ones.
Thus, removing an image from a Design Right only deletes that image on the Design Right, and the respective image
on the Industrial Design is preserved. And vice versa - deleting an image on the Industrial Design will not delete the
image on the existing Design Rights.
When a Design Right is split, it is the images from the parent Design Right that are copied into the newly created 
one(s), not the ones from the Industrial Design.
Multiple Design Applications
If you are filing a multiple design application (have created Design Right records with Application Type = Multiple), 
a Multiple Design Application record will be also created.
Page 351
| 7 - Design Lifecycle
All the affected Design Rights will be linked to it and displayed under the Multiple Design Application's Design 
Rights and Related tabs.
The Design Rights that are part of a multi-application will contain the reference to the related Multiple Design 
Application record in the Multiple Design Application field.
Also, the Design Rights with Application Type=Multiple will have a section called Other Design Rights in Multiple 
Design Application under their Industrial Designs tab, listing all Design Rights from the same Multiple Design 
Application.
Note: When creating child Design Right records with Application Type=Multiple and Relationship to 
Parent=International Design for a Design Right whose Country=WO and Application Type=Multiple, 
a new Multiple Design Application grouping the child Design Rights will not be created, and the already 
existing Multiple Design Application with Country=WO will be linked to these children.
Page 352
IPfolio User Guide
Data Propagation
When creating Design Right records, certain fields are copied to them from the Design Family/Multiple Design
Application records (depending on the way Design Rights are created, or from parent to child Design Rights.
From the Design Family to Design Rights
When using Create Design Rights on a Design Family, the following fields are propagated from the Design Family to
the Design Rights created from it (in case there is no Parent Design Right established for the records created):
âª Title
âª Firm Attorney
âª Law firm
âª In-House Counsel
âª Law Firm Reference
If these fields are added on the Design Rights Creation Additional Fields field set, they will be displayed and autopopulated in the table on the Create Design Rights screen and can be further edited, if needed.
From the Multiple Design Application to Design Rights
When creating a Design Right and linking it to a Multiple Design Application (MDA) using the Multiple Design 
Application field (or updating the existing Design Right with the MDA reference), the following fields are
propagated from the MDA to the Design Right:
âª Registration Date
âª Registration Number
âª Filing Date
âª Application Number
If the field values on the Design Right are not further modified and stay the same as on the MDA, every time those
fields are edited on the MDA, they will be accordingly updated on the Design Right as well.
If the Design Right dates have been individually modified after the initial propagation, the MDA updates will not
change them.
Note:
When there are several Design Rights related to a Multiple Design Application (MDA) where Country=EM,
these Design Rights inherit the MDA's Application Number and Registration Number, with the suffixes
added to these numbers on the Design Rights based on the creation order (-0001, -0002, etc.). The 
propagated values can further on be modified.
If Application Number and/or Registration Number are updated on the MDA, they are also updated on the
associated Design Rights, even if you previously manually changed the values on individual Design Rights.
If a Design Right is added to the MDA after Application Number and/or Registration Number have been set,
the Design Right suffix is set to the next sequential number available.
From Parentto Child Design Rights
The following fields are propagated from parent to child Design Rights upon subsequent filing creation (both when 
child records are created from the Design family and as a result of the Design Right splitting):
Page 353
| 7 - Design Lifecycle
âª Title
âª Description
âª Design Family
âª Firm Attorney
âª Law firm
âª In-House Counsel
âª Law Firm Reference
If added on the Design Right's Design Rights Creation Additional Fields field set, these fields are going to be 
displayed and auto-populated in the table on the Create Design Rights screen, where their values can be edited for 
the newly created Design Rights (except for the Design Family field, which can't be modified).
If you keep the original parent Design Right's values of these fields on the child records, and later on update them on
the parent Design Right, they will be updated on child records as well.
If the parent Design Right's Country=WO, in addition to the above-listed fields the subsequent applications also
inherit Filing Date and Application Number.
Designers
IPfolio distinguishes between Design Family Designers, Industrial Design Designers and Design Right Designers.
The Design module has three primary objects â Design Families, Industrial Designs, and Design Rights, each having
its own Designer object that holds related designers:
Primary Object Designer Object Designers
Design Family Designer (Design Family) Design Family Designers
Industrial Design Designer (Industrial Design) Industrial Design Designers
Design Right Designer Design Right Designers
First, you need to add designers to the Design Family. This will also generate the creation of Designer (Design
Family) records.
When creating Industrial Designs from the Design Family further on, you can add designers to Industrial Designs.
You can select only from the designers that already exist on the related Design Family. Once designers are added on
an Industrial Design record, the respective Designer (Industrial Design) records will be created. If necessary, you can
later on edit designers on Industrial Design records.
When creating Design Rights from a Design Family, designers are propagated to the Design Rights from the related
Industrial Designs, and the respective Designer records are created.
You can store multiple designers for a single Design Family, Industrial Design or Design Right record.
Design Family Designers
A Designer (Design Family) is a Party (where Type=Person) associated with a Design Family record.
Designer (Design Family) records are:
âª Listed in the Designers (Design Family) related list under the Related tab on Design Family records.
âª Stored in the Designer (Design Family) object.
âª Linked to Party records.
Page 354
IPfolio User Guide
Adding Designers to a Design Family
Please always start with adding designers to a Design Family first.
1. Open a Design Family record.
2. Open the Related tab.
3. In the Designers (Design Family) section click New.
4. Fill in the Designer field by selecting a Party from the dropdown list.
5. Click Save.
Industrial Design Designers
A Designer (Industrial Design) is a Party (where Type=Person) associated with an Industrial Design record.
Designer (Industrial Design) records are:
âª Listed in the Designers (Industrial Design) related list under the Related tab on Industrial Design records.
âª Stored in the Designer (Industrial Design) object.
âª Linked to Party records.
Designers are added to Industrial Designs upon creation (on page 341) and can be further edited (on page 342).
Design Right Designers
A Designer is a Party (where Type=Person) associated with a Design Right record.
Designer records are:
âª Listed in the Designers related list under the Related tab on Design Right records.
âª Stored in the Designer object.
âª Linked to Party records.
When creating Design Rights from a Design Family, Designers are propagated to the Design Rights from the related
Industrial Designs (if those have Designers added).
Page 355
Chapter 8. Other Record Types
Apart from patents and trademarks, you can use IPfolio for handling conflicts, copyrights, domain names and
general matters.
Conflicts
The IPfolio Conflicts module enables you to track information related to ongoing offensive or defensive conflicts.
The Conflicts module includes:
âª Standard fields like Status.
âª Custom fields like Case Name, Case Number, Case Type, Country/Jurisdiction, Current Demand/Offer, 
Resolution Date, and Resolution Details.
âª A Conflict Type field with âAssertionsâ, âOppositionâ, âLitigationâ and âAppealâ.
âª A Stance field to indicate whether the conflict is offensive or defensive.
Figure 45. Conflict record
Use the Relations tab to link conflicts to other records (patents, parties, and even other conflicts), and track Classes
& Goods both for internal trademarks and third party trademarks - e.g., the ones infringing on the rights of your
trademarks. For more details on the Classes & Goods section, please see Trademarks (on page 311).
Page 356
IPfolio User Guide
You can also clone a Conflict using the Clone button (you will be suggested to use the next sequential Conflict ID for
the newly created Conflict record).
Conflicts include the standard functionality you expect from IPfolio. See Core Features (on page 161).
Contracts
IPfolio allows for the definition and management of different types of Contracts.
Contracts support information like important Contract Dates, Title, Comments, Contract Type. Relationships 
can be established with Parties, Patent Families, Trademark Families, Patents, Trademarks and Third Party
Trademarks under the Related tab. Additionally, Costs as well as Income are recordable.
Figure 46. Overview
You can send information and documents to a specific Contract record in IPfolio via Email by using the
corresponding ContractID in the subject line of an Email. The Email and any attachments are saved in the
Documents section of the associated Contract record.
Use the Finance tab to link Contracts to Costs and Income records.

Copyrights
With the IPfolio Copyrights module, you can manage copyright records in a similar way to patent and trademark
records.
We have completely re-worked and standardized our Copyrights module. We have:
âª Added all the key components customers expect from our core offerings â a robust Documents section,
Inbound email functionality and more.
âª Added and reorganized Copyright and Prosecution fields.
âª Added business logic to automatically manage the record status.
âª Added the latest improvements from our standard Lightning Record Page layout, including a record image
component.
Copyrights also feature a new âPathâ component. Path displays the current recordâs status, and when expanded,
provides access to key fields and context-sensitive help (âGuidance for Successâ).

Domain Names
You can manage and track domain names using the Domain Names module.
Page 359
| 8 - Other Record Types
The Domain Names module has three parts â Domain Name Extensions, Domain Name Families, and Domain 
Names.
Domain Name Extensions
First, make sure you have Domain Name Extensions records for each top-level domain you want to track. (.com, 
.org, and .cn for example.) These top-level domain records store domain-specific information, and are used when
creating domain names.
Domain Name Families
Next, create a Domain Name Family record for each domain you want to track. For example, we might create a
Domain Name Families record for ipfolio.
Domain Names
Finally, with your Domain Name Extensions and Domain Name Families records ready, creating individual Domain
Names records is easy. From a Domain Name Families record, click Create Domain Names. (See above.) Select a
single top-level domain, or hold down the CTRL (Windows) or CMD (Mac) key to select multiple top-level domains.
Note: You can also create a Domain Name without a related Domain Name Family (Domain Name
Extension still being necessary). For this, click New in the Domain Names list view (or New Domain Name 
from the Domain Names navigation bar item), fill in the fields in the pop up window and click Save.
Domain Name Assignment History
The Related Assignment Histories section lets you track the assignment history of Domain Name records. Select
a Domain Name record, scroll down to the Related Assignment Histories section, and click New Domain Name 
Assignment History, fill in the fields, and click Save. The new Assignment is added to the Assignment Histories 
related list.
Page 360
IPfolio User Guide
Features
Domain Name records come with the rich functionality youâve come to expect from IPfolio:
âª Custom fields store important information about your domain names.
âª Domain Name Family records group related Domain Name records.
âª The module includes robust search and reporting capabilities.
See Core Features (on page 161) for a list of standard features.
General Matters
The General Matters module lets you track relatively small numbers of general records of various types, without the
need for specialized modules or custom configuration.
If you have thousands of patents, clearly you should use our dedicated Patents module. Similarly, a robust trademark
portfolio belongs in our dedicated Trademarks module. But what if you have a small number of general legal matters,
or a handful of licenses you want to track?
Our General Matters module is a great place to track relatively small numbers of general records of various types,
without the need for specialized modules or custom configuration.
General Matter records are intentionally generic. Customers can add records of different typesââ licenses, 
litigation, acquisitions and divestments, analyses, or other general legal matters.
Note: The number of General Matter records isnât limited. However, having thousands of records of a
particular type usually indicates an important business process worthy of using a dedicated module, like the
IPfolio Contracts module, or creating a separate custom object.
Figure 49. General Matter record
General Matters include:
âª Standard fields including General Matter Detail, Important Milestones, and Resolution.
âª General Matter Parties for tracking parties associated with General Matters, in their various roles.
âª Links to Related Invention Disclosure, Patent, Patent Family, Trademark, Contract, and/or Product records.
âª General Matters include all the standard functionality you expect from IPfolio. See Core Features (on page 161).
Products
IPfolio provides comprehensive tools for managing your major product lines.
Page 361
| 8 - Other Record Types
With Products you can track key commercial information such as Annual Revenue, Market Attractiveness, and 
Market Share, as well as competitorsâ products that you would like to map your IP assets to.
Mapping your IP to your product lines will open up a strategic perspective on how your IP activities are aligned
with the state and development of your actual business. You can relate Products to Patents, Trademarks, Patent
Families, Trademark Families and EOU.
All the way down on the Patent Family and/or Patents page, you can add relations to Products for tying your Patents
to your business. As part of your setup, you will want to decide whether you want to link Products to individual
Patents/Trademarks, as opposed to creating those links at the Patent/Trademark Family level.
Page 362
Chapter 9. IP Data Synchronization
The IPfolio data feed services help you keep your IP data up-to-date, with information from external records on
IPsync, IP One Data, and CompuMark Sync.
How It Works
Our data feed services compare your IPfolio patent and trademark data with data from our various data providers,
and then updates records by:
Key Differences
While the services work the same conceptually, there are important differences too. For example, each service:
âª Uses a different data provider.
âª Includes different bibliographic fields.
âª Downloads different documents.
âª Updates with varying frequency.
Table: Example: IPsync vs. IP ONE Data
IPsync IP ONE Data
Included IP Rights Patents and Trademarks
Patents only
Coverage US, CN, EP, JP, TW, WO Most countries (public records)
Private Records US Public only
Documents All available documents Publication and/or Grant PDFs
Sync Frequency Daily Weekly
Tip:
In the following sections, consider:
Page 363
| 9 - IP Data Synchronization
â¢ Which jurisdictions are included?
â¢ Which bibliographic fields are included?
â¢ Which documents are downloaded?
â¢ How do we match external records?
â¢ How often do we check for updates?
Knowing the answers for the services you use makes using them easier and more predictable.
Data Audits
IPfolio data feed services compare your patent and trademark records with external records from our data
providers.
When a discrepancy is found between your record and the external record, a Data Audit is created that lets you
âAcceptâ or âDiscardâ the value from the external record.
Note: We also create Data Audits for values proposed by business logic.
How It Works
When IPfolio finds a matching external record, it compares the field values on your record with the field values on
the external record. For a given field:
If â¦ Then IPfolioâ¦
The values on the internal and external records 
match
Does nothing
The external record has a value/the internal 
record has no value
Copies the value to the internal record
The values on the internal and external records 
differ
Creates a Data Audit
Accept or Discard
Data audits show the current field value and the proposed value from the external record.
âª Click Accept to replace the current value with the proposed value from the external record.
âª Click Discard to keep the current value.
For example, assume:
âª An internal record with a Term Adjustment of 100 days.
âª An external record with a Term Adjustment of 200 days.
Table: âAcceptâ vs.âDiscardâ
Action Term Adjustment Value
Data Audit Status New Data Audit During Next Sync?
Accept 200 Accepted No, there is no longer a discrepancy
Discard 100 Discarded No, the existing data audit is still 
valid
Page 364
IPfolio User Guide
Recommendation
We suggest you process data audits daily. Data Audits are valid for specific combinations of current/proposed
values. If these values change before you Accept or Discard the data audit, IPfolio invalidates the original data audit
and creates a new one.
Tip: âInvalidatedâ data audits can be confusing. The best way to avoid them is to âAcceptâ or âDiscardâ data
audits often.
Deleting Data Audits
You can delete data audit records. We sometimes delete data audits during troubleshooting to force IPfolio to create
new ones.
While generally safe, deleting data audits is not usually necessary (or desirable).
Review needed
If there is an existing, unprocessed data audit and you run a synchronization, the message Review Needed is 
displayed.
When new data audits are created during the same synchronization, the message Review Needed along with a list 
of these new data audits is displayed.
New Data Audits on Updated Values
You will receive a new data audit if the external data source reports a new value against a synced field again, even
if the value was previously discarded. This occurs only when the newly reported value differs from the earlier
discarded data. If the value on the discarded data audit matches the current value in the record, it will not be 
reopened.
Data Audit Records
Data Audit records contain information specific to data audits but are otherwise like any other IPfolio records. You
can create List Views, run Reports, and more.

Page 366
IPfolio User Guide
âª Data Audits start with a Status of New
âª âAcceptingâ a data audit changes its Status to Accepted.
âª âDiscardingâ a data audit changes its Status to Discarded.
âª Superseded data audits are changed to Invalidated.
Data Source
Data Source is the source of the Proposed Value.
Field Name
Field Name is the field for which data is being compared.
Confidence of Match
IP One Data assigns a score of Low/Medium/High to express its confidence that it has identified the
correct record.
Value in IPfolio
Value in IPfolio is the current field value in IPfolio.
Proposed Value
Proposed Value is the value from the external record being considered.
List Views
IPfolio includes a List View called New or New Trademark Sync that only shows data audits with a Status of âNewâ.
When you click Accept or Discard, the status changes and the data audits no longer show in the New List View.
Customers also create List Views that filter on Data Source to:
âª Show data audits for specific data feed services.
âª Show changes to specific fields, such as owner or goods and services.
âª Show data audits generated by IPfolio business logic.
Accepting or Discarding Proposed Values for Multiple Audits
From the Data Audits list view, you can select multiple data audit records, and then either accept or discard the
changes.

Accepting Data Audits by Editing the Status Field
Large volumes of Data Audits can be handled by changing the value of the Status field.
Page 370
IPfolio User Guide
You can accept Data Audits using the Status field. This process allows you to mass-update the status for thousands
of Data Audits by simply changing the value of the Status field.
When a Data Auditâs status changes from New to Accepted, all further steps associated with accepting Data Audits are 
executed. These include copying values into the record, creating Classes & Goods for Trademarks, and generating
Parties.
Note: This feature is currently exclusively available for accepting Data Audits.
IP Right ID Data Audit
You may sometimes be confronted with data audits concerning the field "IP Right ID" with a new proposed value.
These data audits need to be handled differently.
Figure 51. Data audit with the field name IP Right ID
IPsync creates these so-called âIP Right IDâ data audits when it has a Patent Center Private View (former Private
PAIR) record, but canât find a matching IPfolio patent record.
Fixing the Underlying Cause
When you get an IP Right ID data audit, we encourage you to fix the underlying cause of the data audit.
âª The patent exists but IPsync canât find it because of a malformed Application Number.
âª The patent doesnât exist.
Use the following table to fix the underlying cause.
Reason Recommended Action
Malformed Application Number Fix the Application Number (on page 323).
Patent Doesnât Exist Create the patent normally (e.g., click Create Patent from the parent application).
After performing the recommended action:
âª Re-sync the record.
âª Delete the IP Right ID data audit.
Accepting the IP Right ID Data Audit
We encourage you to fix the underlying cause of the IP Right ID data audit.
If you choose to Accept the data audit:
âª IPsync creates a new IPfolio patent record.
âª IPsync runs a second time (on the new record) to retrieve the bibliographic data and Image File Wrapper files.
Page 371
| 9 - IP Data Synchronization
Important: Accepting the IP Right ID data audit may result in a duplicate patent or a patent that is not
properly linked to other records. We encourage you to Fixing the Underlying Cause (on page 371) instead.
Data Synchronization Rules
By default IPfolio auto-populates values when your record is missing a value, and creates a data audit when there is
a discrepancy. Data synchronization rules can be customized for fields.
Field Sets
IPfolio patent and trademark records include field sets (Salesforce) you can use to change the default behavior.
There are two settings for field sets:
Always require Sync Log validation
IPfolio always creates Data Audits for these fields. External data is never auto-populated for these
fields.
Update without Sync Log
Data Audits for these fields are automatically âAcceptedâ.
These field sets are mutually exclusive. You can include a field in one or the other, but you should not include a field
in both.
Note:
If a discrepancy fails to be synced, it is skipped, and the sync continues to update/create new Data Audits 
without stopping.
For the discrepancies that failed to sync/contain invalid formats, a log file is created, and a warning message
appears informing you of a sync error and the log.
Notification Email
IPfolio sends a daily notification email to users when there are new data audits, which includes a link to the Data 
Audits screen.
Recipients
By default, a notification email is sent to the record owner of each data audit. You can override this behavior to
either send all notifications to one or more recipients of your choosing, or to disable the feature and not send any
notifications.
Use the Data Audit Notification Recipient(s) custom setting to customize the recipients.
âª When Data Audit Notification Recipient(s) is empty, emails are sent to individual record owners (the default
behavior).
âª When one or more email address(es) are entered, emails are sent to those addresses.
âª When a dash (â-â) is entered, no data audit notification emails are sent. (The feature is disabled.)
IPfolio can send email to any email address entered in Data Audit Notification Recipient(s). A Contact with a 
matching email address is required to send the email.
Page 372
IPfolio User Guide
âª If a matching Contact is found, IPfolio uses it.
âª If a matching Contact is not found, IPfolio creates one.
Template
The text of the email sent to recipients is controlled by the âData_Audit_New_Entriesâ Custom Email Template.
âª To change the text of the data audit notification email, change this template.
âª The â{0}â and â{1}â are placeholders that insert a link to the data audits page and the name of the recipient.
Deleting this template doesnât prevent IPfolio from sending data audit messages. (IPfolio continues sending
messages using internal text.) For details on preventing IPfolio from sending data audit notification emails, see the
Recipients section above.
Implementation Details
The âIPfolio Data Audits Email Notificationsâ scheduled job runs DataAuditDailyEmailAlert_Batch.cls daily. This is
configured during initial org setup.
âª To change the recipients or disable the feature, see Recipients (on page 372) above.
âª To edit the text of the email, see Template (on page 373).
IPsync
IPsync connects your IPfolio data to online data from selected jurisdictions.
IPsync:
âª Adds missing bibliographic data to your records.
âª Reconciles differences in bibliographic data, letting you âAcceptâ or âDiscardâ proposed changes.
âª Downloads available documents.
The data and documents from IPsync provide varying degrees of auto-docketing.
âª DocketEngine uses downloaded documents and updated bibliographic data from IPsync to create tasks using
our Country Law rule engine.
âª For non-DocketEngine customers, we use downloaded US documents to create Actions, generating a current
Case History summary.

Eligible Records
IPsync works with publicly available records from eligible Jurisdictions (on page 373).
IPsync works with some private records, namely Patent Center Private View records you make available to us.
To make Patent Center Private View records available to us:
âª Each firm creates a Customer Number they use for your applications.
âª Each firm adds you to the Customer Number so you see those applications when you login to Patent Center.
Your goal is to see the correct Customer Numbers and applications when you login to Patent Center.
âª Once that is done, you âsponsor usâ (so we see what you see.)
âª Until then, keep working with your firms to âclean upâ your Customer Numbers and applications, and let us know
when that is done.

Documents
IPsync downloads files to the Documents section of the current record. We process downloaded .pdf files to make
them text searchable in IPfolio.
âª For US records, IPsync downloads the complete Image File Wrapper and saves them in a folder called âPAIRâ.
âª For non-US records, IPsync downloads available prosecution documents and saves them in a folder called
âOfficial Registerâ.
Patent Center documents include a unique feature that enables us to use them auto-docket actions. Each Patent
Center document includes a Document Code that uniquely identifies the document type. Because we can tell if a 
downloaded Patent Center document is a Notice of Allowance, a Non-Final Rejection, or any other type of office action,
we use Patent Center documents to auto-docket actions.
Note: Patent Center documents are the only documents used to docket actions.

IPsync downloads available prosecution documents and saves them in a folder called âOfficial Registerâ.
Sync Details
IPsync does not get data from PTOs directly. Instead, we use a data provider whose primary focus is collecting and
updating data from various jurisdictions.
Daily Checks
Our provider checks PTO records daily, looking for status updates that indicate meaningful changes have occurred.
They update their records accordingly. IPsync focuses on reconciling (or âsyncingâ) data in your IPfolio records with
the normalized data supplied by our provider.
Note: Our data provider scrapes data from various PTOs. IPsync synchronizes your IPfolio data with data
from our provider, looking for discrepancies.
Understanding this separation is helpful, especially when trying to understand when updates appear in IPfolio. For
example:
Page 376
IPfolio User Guide
It is accurate to say IPsync compares IPfolio records with our providerâs records daily. But it also helps to remember:
âª The data needs to be available from the PTO.
âª Our provider needs time to get the updates.
âª We need time to sync your records with data from our provider.
Many updates docketed at the PTO are available in IPfolio the following day. Applications filed late in the day are
likely processed by the PTO the following day, and appear in IPfolio the day after that.
A good rule of thumb is that updates docketed at the PTO are generally available in IPfolio 2-3 days after you see
them in Patent Center Private View (former Private PAIR).
Important: Patents and Trademarks in the Closed, Lapsed, or Sold (+ Finally Lapsed for Patents) status are
not synced, and their statuses don't get updated upon IPsync data retrieval.
Advanced Scraper
As stated above, most updates are available 2-3 days after they appear in Patent Center Private View. However,
there are exceptions.
A small subset of actions may take considerably longer, the most notable example being a Response to Office Action. 
These may take 7-10 days (or longer) due to how they are processed by the USPTO.
Our provider offers an advanced scraping option that reduces the wait for these actions. There is an additional fee
since this requires them to scrape all records every day (as opposed to those the PTO marks as updated.) There are
three options (sorted in descending order by cost.)
âª Perform an immediate update of applications every day.
âª In addition to the standard daily update service, perform an immediate update of pending applications every 3
calendar days.
âª In addition to the standard daily update service, perform an immediate update of pending applications every 7
calendar days.
Note: Advanced Scraping is required for WO / CN sync since there is no monitored date to be used.
Discrepancy Reconciliation
IPsync primarily uses the Application Number to match IPfolio records with PTO records.
If no Application Number is found in an IPfolio record, the system tries to populate it with the USPTO value, based
on matching Attorney Docket Number and Law Firm Reference numbers in the respective records.
Bibliographic fields are handled as follows:
âª If your value and the PTO value are the same, no action is taken.
âª If your field is empty, and the PTO has a value, we add the PTO value to your record.
âª If your value and the PTO value differ, we do not change your record. Instead, we create a Data Audit entry 
noting the difference.
See Data Audits (on page 364) for details.
Page 377
| 9 - IP Data Synchronization
Note: When the system tries to create new Data Audit Logs related to a record whose Owner is inactive,
it assigns any other System Administrator of the org, whose email does not contain @ipfolio or 
@clarivate, as owner of these new Data Audit Logs, and the sync is successfully completed.

PatentStrengthâ¢
IP One Data includes Innographyâs PatentStrengthâ¢ score (found in the Patent Strength Indicator field on patents)
â an algorithmic estimate of âstrengthâ providing a predictive indicator for a patentâs likelihood of being involved
with litigation.
PatentStrengthâ¢ is widely recognized in the industry as an objective scoring mechanism and is used in diverse
verticals for comparing a portfolio to an industry or competitive portfolios. PatentStrengthâ¢ scores how strong a
specific patent is and can vary between 0 and 100. The higher the score, the stronger the patent. (A score of 70 and 
higher is generally considered âstrong.â)
Algorithm:
The algorithm is based on a regression analysis of litigated patents and strongly correlated with patents that end up 
in litigation. While the exact logic is proprietary, the following items are considered in calculating Patent Strength:
Litigation
This is a key item â extensive research indicates that litigation correlates strongly with
strength. Algorithm considers patents involved in litigation as well as patents opposed 
during filing. Strong patents are defended, often heavily, by their owners. Patents not
directly involved in a litigation are also considered in the strength calculation, although 
the impact on the score is very minimal.
Claims Patent claims describe the scope of protection that has been granted by the patent.
More claims indicate broader protection for the patented technology.
References References are the technology and prior art that a patent stands upon. More references 
indicate a broader technology base and, consequently, a stronger patent.
Classifications A number of main-group classification codes are used to identify patents in important 
technological fields.
Citations Citations indicate that the patent is used as prior art. The more frequently a given patent 
is cited, the more foundationalâand therefore valuableâit tends to be.
Expiration Expired patents are not as strong or valuable in comparison with active ones.
Using this approach, different patents are objectively compared, and the result - a normalized patent strength score
- is weekly recalculated and mapped against a distribution curve across all patents.
Where does this come from?
Innographyâs PatentStrengthâ¢ algorithm is based on the paper Valuable Patents by John R. Allison, Mark A. Lemley,
Kimberly A. Moore, and R. Derek Trunkey. Covering nearly 3,000,000 patents and over 4,000 patent lawsuits, it
is the most comprehensive study of the patent system, and associated value, ever conducted. Starting from the
basic assumption that patents are litigated because of their intrinsic value, the researchers explored additional
characteristics of these patents. We have extended and refined this research into our proprietary PatentStrengthâ¢
calculations.

Documents
IP One Data downloads the Publication and Grant PDFs for eligible records.
Note:
For issued patents, we download the Grant PDF only.
Not all PDFs are text-searchable. However, some are, including:
âª US documents are OCRâd by IP One from approximately 2001 on
âª EP documents are provided in OCRâd form directly from the EPO
âª WO documents are provided in OCRâd form directly from WIPO
Sync Details
IP One Data checks eligible records for updates weekly. You can check for updates on individual records anytime. IP
One Data only checks active patents.
Note: Patents with a status of âNot Filedâ, âClosedâ, âSoldâ, âLapsedâ, or âFinally Lapsedâ are considered
inactive. All other statuses are considered âactiveâ.
Discrepancy Reconciliation
IPsync and IP One Data use the same Data Audits (Sync Logs) feature, letting you âAcceptâ or âDiscardâ proposed
changes.
However, there are important differences between how the two services match records. This affects the Data Audit
changes we propose too.
IPsync
IPsync matches internal and external records primarily by Application Number. When a match is found, it
automatically populates empty fields, and creates Data Audits when there is a discrepancy.
Key takeaways:
âª IPsync matches on a single field.
âª Matches are binary â there is either a match or there isnât.
âª IPsync behaves the same for all matches. (Populating empty fields and creating Data Audits when there is a
discrepancy.)

IP One Data searches for matching records from a vast array of public records from many different jurisdictions,
using a complex algorithm that considers multiple fields to find matches.
When a match is found, a unique identifier is returned that detects a specific case in the IP One Data system.
Two important data points that are essential for a match to occur:
Page 384
IPfolio User Guide
1. The jurisdiction of the case must be supported by IP One Data coverage. We currently cover over 175
jurisdictions for bibliographic information and 75+ jurisdictions for full text information, our main sources
being the EPO and the USPTO. We also supplement information from third-party sources.
2. A match can only be performed against published applications. IP One Data doesnât have access to prepublished applications.
Confidence of Match
IP One Data assigns a score of High/Medium/Low/None to express its confidence that it has identified the correct
record.
For a bigger chance of a high confidence match, as much of the following data as possible is recommended to be sent
to IP One Data:
âª Country Code (required)
âª Filing Type (or Type Code (on page 386) - the filing route of the application, to be indicated in the IPR Subtype 
field)
âª Publication Number
âª Application Number
âª Grant Number
âª Application Date
âª Publication Date
âª Grant Date
âª Inventor(s)
âª Title
Other data that donât influence the confidence:
âª PCT Number
âª PCT Date
âª Parent Number
âª Parent Date
The algorithm categorizes numbers, dates and text fields from the above list and uses a scoring mechanism by
assigning a series of points from positive to negative for each value that is matched/not matched with public data to
suggest a confidence in the match:
1. The numbers (application, publication, grant) are compared as a first pass and receive a positive/negative
point based on a match.
2. The dates (filing, publication, grant) are then compared and assigned a validation score increasing or
decreasing the confidence.
3. The text fields are the last category that also play a part in the confidence but doesnât majorly alter it.
According to the number of corresponding values sent in the request, matching results are graded in one of the four
categories and determine how IP One Data handles data from the matched record:
âª High: A high confidence match would most likely occur when as many above-mentioned fields as possible
are sent and matched. For example, if three values from the Dates or Numbers (Application, Publication, or
Grant) are identical or, in addition, a text field like Inventor is matched. Like with IPsync, values will be written
immediately into empty fields in IPfolio (unless the field is included in the 'Always Create Sync Log' field set), and
Sync Logs are created for discrepancies (i.e., there is already an existing value in IPfolio).
Page 385
| 9 - IP Data Synchronization
âª Medium: The (Dates Filing, Publication, and Grant) are compared in addition to the Numbers and results
increase or decrease the confidence of a match. If none of the dates are provided, the best case is medium
confidence. A Data Audit (Sync Log) will always be generated, just like for any fields that are configured in the
'Always Create Sync Log' field set.
âª Low: No data will be written, and no Sync Log created. The matching attempt is only logged in the IP One Sync
Details object. This occurs when minimal or incorrect data is sent in the request. Low confidence match does not
always mean that the return is not an accurate match. The algorithm cannot conclusively attest to the validity
because there is too little information available.
âª None: No match was found because:
âª Incorrect information was provided, OR
âª The application has not been published yet, OR
âª The jurisdiction or the IP Type is not supported by IP One Data. For example: Design coverage is very sparse
in IP One Data or there are countries where the EPO lacks coverage for certain countries, or the coverage
is delayed (For example: India, Hong Kong, Korea, China, Italy, Germany and more). Countries where data
is up to date can be referenced from the IP One Data (IP1D) Coverage Guide - see page 5, Table 3: Patent
Coverage Summary (The entry 'Present' in the 'Latest Date' column indicates that the jurisdiction is up-todate as of the latest available information.).
âLast Match Successfulâ
Last Match Successful indicates whether a potential match was found the last time the system checked.
âª âTrueâ indicates a potential match in the IP One database.
âª âFalseâ indicates no match was found.
Type Code
Type Code is the 'filing route' of an application and an important attribute that increases the likelihood of a high
confidence match in case of EP designated countries, PCT nationalized countries. Consumers can concatenate 
the IP Right and filing types in the IPR Subtype field in the Match Request and all concatenated values will be 
appropriately considered in determining a match candidate. For example: DEN_EUR for an EU design, UTM_PCT for
PCT Utility model.
Type Codes that are currently supported:
Code Description
ARP ARIPO Patent Application
EAR Eurasian Patent Application
EUR European Patent Application
PCT PCT Application
Page 386
IPfolio User Guide
When a Type Code is applicable to a case, the Country Code should show the designated country.
Interpretations/Possible Explanations of Scores
âª A High Confidence match can almost always be treated as an accurate match. We recommend that a user
review be involved with Medium and Low Confidence matches.
âª Low Confidence is typically the result of bad data or too little data in IPfolio:
IP One has found a record that could be a match, but there is too little information or contradictory information.
For example, if only an Application Number is provided in IPfolio, and/or the Filing Date or Publication Number
(or other Date and/or Number), which the matching logic could use as supporting evidence that it found the
correct record, is mistyped, the system will likely return a Low Confidence rating.
âª No Match typically means there is no published record, the possible reasons being:
1. an unsupported or lagging jurisdiction (e.g., India, Italy) or type of IP (Designs, Trademarks), or
2. a type of patent that doesnât get separately published by the patent offices (most EP national
validations), or
3. the application not being published yet, or being a provisional, or similar.
âª If there is more than one Filing, Publication, or Grant event in the case, the event with the latest performed date
is used.
âª The algorithm takes into consideration various number formats per jurisdiction and publication date (for
jurisdictional number format updates over time), special characters, trailing and leading spaces and zeros before
executing the match.
âª Grant dates for the following jurisdictions are calculated from the legal status events (JP, AR, BR, PT, HK) and
cannot guarantee accuracy.
âª Australian grant dates that we receive from the EPO have also been unreliable and are returned with a â301â
status code that can be flagged in the consuming system.
Sample IP One Sync Detail Record
In the following hypothetical example, a customer checked the IP One Sync Details and found:
âª Confidence of Match: âLowâ
âª Last Match Successful: âTrueâ
Both can affect whether data is imported into IPfolio, but for different reasons:
âª A Last Match Successful value of âTrueâ means the system found a potential match in the IP One database. 
(âFalseâ would indicate no match found.)
âª A Confidence of Match value of âLowâ indicates that although there may be a match, the system canât be certain
it is the right record.
Either way, no data is imported. (No action is taken when matching confidence is âLowâ.)
Schedule and Ad Hoc
âª Eligible records are automatically checked weekly.
âª Document syncs are skipped for records where the necessary documents already exist, improving system
performance.
âª Click IP One Sync on a patent to perform an ad-hoc sync.

âª Mark image.
CompuMark Sync uses IPfolio Data Audits (on page 364), making it easy to âAcceptâ or âDiscardâ proposed
changes.
CompuMark Trademark Databases
CompuMark includes data from 186 trademark databases. Our database includes International Register, EU
nationals, EU trademarks, European microstates, Switzerland, and Norway.
Data Integrity is of great importance to CompuMark, as these statistics demonstrate:
âª 40% of records enhanced to improve precision
âª 10% of USPTO records corrected on average
âª 1.1% of EUIPO records corrected on average
Note: Generally, CompuMark removes inactive trademarks after 3 years, pending applications and renewals
under a new number â after 2 years. This applies to most of the major trademark registers, but there are
exceptions for some countries. Besides, please bear in mind that some "older"trademarks that are still
under review might also appear in the search results.
Included Fields
CompuMark includes numerous bibliographic fields, such as applicant, registered owner, and application date/
number.
Bibliographic Fields

Important:
âª Please bear in mind that for some of the above-mentioned fields the data retrieval is jurisdictiondependent (e.g., Cancelled/Abandoned Date is currently not retrieved by CompuMark for Australia,
Publication Date - for New Zealand, etc.). Those fields should be controlled and filled in manually.
âª If you would like to have an indication when your trademark needs to be renewed/expires, we
recommend that you include all of the following three fields: Renewal Date (CompuMark), Next
Renewal Date (CompuMark) and Expiry Date (CompuMark). Please note that these dates are not 
calculated by the system but retrieved from PTO records, so the data availability depends on whether
the date is published by a local trademark office.
Derived Fields
During updates, we look up related IPfolio records and populate the following fields:
IPfolio Field Name API Name
Base Trademark ID IPfolio__Base_Trademark_ID__c
Earliest Priority Filing ID IPfolio__Earliest_Priority_Filing_ID__c
Additionally, our business logic may update other trademark fields, including:
IPfolio Field Name API Name
Status (High-Level) IPfolio__IP_Right_Status__c
Status (Prosecution) IPfolio__Prosecution_Status__c
Applicants
The CompuMark API includes Applicant data. We use this to populate the Original Applicant and Registered 
Owner fields in IPfolio.
Details
IPfolio trademark records include two fields, Original Applicant and Registered Owner, used to identify the 
Applicant and Registered Owner respectively. Original Applicant and Registered Owner are both âParty lookupâ
fields. (You populate them by selecting a party record.)
Page 390
IPfolio User Guide
While itâs possible to have multiple applicants, itâs uncommon. We use the first applicant if multiple applicants are
found.
CompuMark Sync uses âApplicantâ data from the CompuMark API to populate Original Applicant and Registered 
Owner using the following logic.
For Original Applicant and Registered Owner:
âª If the field is blank, and we find an existing party that matches the CompuMark Applicant, we populate the field
with the matching party.
âª If the field is blank, and we do not find an existing party that matches the CompuMark Applicant, we create a
party and populate the field with the party.
âª If the field has a value, and we find an existing party that matches the CompuMark Applicant, we create a Data
Audit.
âª If the field has a value, and we do not find an existing party that matches the CompuMark Applicant, we create a
party and a Data Audit.
âª If the field is included in the 'Always require Sync Log validation' field set, a new party is not created until a
Data Audit is accepted. If a Data Audit has been accepted, but a party with the suggested name already exists, a
duplicate will not be created.
Note: CompuMark data includes applicantName and applicantNameNative fields, with the latter being 
an untranslated version of applicantName. If applicantName is missing, we use applicantNameNative
instead.
Classes & Goods
CompuMark sync automatically adds Classes & Goods records in CompuMark that are missing from IPfolio.
In addition, CompuMark sync creates data audits to delete Classes & Goods records in IPfolio but not in 
CompuMark data, and creates data audits to reconcile differences in the Goods/Services Description value.
Mark Image
CompuMark Sync retrieves the mark image from CompuMark, adds the image to the Documents section of the
current record, and then sets the image as the ârecord imageâ, to display it prominently on the current record (If the
record image is not already set.).
Figure 52. CompuMark Sync Mark Image
IPfolio uses the CompuMark /images API endpoint to retrieve trademark images.
The API returns a single image for most trademarks. However, there are exceptions, such as designs which often
have multiple images, and some UK edge cases which include multiple image.
Page 391
| 9 - IP Data Synchronization
When multiple images are found, IPfolio downloads all images to Documents, and sets the first found as the ârecord 
imageâ (If the record image is not already set).
The image files have a dpi of 300, and are usually under 1 Mb.
IPfolio downloads the mark image initially but does not check for updates thereafter.
Sync Details
Before IPfolio records can be populated with CompuMark data, we need to find the right external record by
matching it with the internal record, using different Trademark fields.
Initial Match
For the initial match, the matching logic is as follows (we try each combination in order):
1. Try Filing Date / Application Number (as-is)
2. Try Filing Date / Application Number (special characters removed)
3. Try Filing Date / Application Number (special characters and leading zeros removed)
4. Try Registration Date / Registration Number (as-is)
5. Try Registration Date / Registration Number (special characters removed)
Subsequent Matches
âª We add a CompuMark Id to the trademark record after a successful match.
âª We use the CompuMark Id (and not the match logic above) for all subsequent matches.
Note:
Our code prevents most âmismatchesâ. To fix a mismatched record, start by clearing the CompuMark Id
manually.
You can use the Searching Application and Registration Numbers table as a reference for the CompuMark 
jurisdictional search criteria (including searchable Application and Registration Number formats).
If an incoming Filing Date differs from the IPfolio Filing Date, a Data Audit will suggest the incoming date to 
the user. If the user accepts the Data Audit, the sync will re-run, and the record will be matched.
Match Trademarks via IP One Data
CompuMark syncing and matching probability can also be improved by applying the IP One Data matching
algorithm for retrieving CompuMark IDs. Please get in touch with your Administrator in order to enable the option
Match Trademarks via IP One.
Manual Sync
To sync an individual record, use the CompuMark Sync button on the trademark record. This works the same as it
does with other data feed integrations (IP ONE, IPsync, etc.)
Daily Sync
IPfolio manages daily syncs automatically.
Page 392
IPfolio User Guide
âª CompuMark remembers synced records for the current org.
âª CompuMark sends each org a list of updated records.
âª Receiving a list of records triggers a bulk update of those records in IPfolio.
Mark Image
IPfolio downloads the mark image initially but does not check for updates thereafter.
International Designations
When a sync is performed on a child trademark whose parent's Country Code = WO, to avoid linking International
Designations to local jurisdiction details based on Application/Registration Numbers that might match local
jurisdictions, the following logic is in place:
âª If there is a value in the CompuMark ID field on the parent WO trademark, it is used to perform a sync on the
child record.
âª If CompuMark ID on the parent WO record is blank, WO is used instead of the childâs Country Code.
CompuMark Trademark Watch
CompuMark Trademark Watch helps you protect and manage your brands with the earliest notification available, so
you donât miss opposition deadlines.
The IPfolio/CompuMark Trademark Watch integration makes using CompuMark trademark watch easier for IPfolio
customers.

Watched Trademarks
IPfolio retrieves existing trademarks and syncs watch orders with CompuMark. The Watched Trademark field is 
populated with the name of the watched trademark. If no existing trademark is found, the watch order is still linked
to the Watched Trademark field, allowing for manual linking with Trademarks/Trademark Families later.
Data Migration
When initiating the CompuMark Trademark Watch, 100 days of backdated watch results from the integration date
are migrated. This is a CompuMark standard.
If you wish to migrate more than the standard 100 days of backdated data, please contact the implementation team
before setting up the CompuMark Trademark Watch integration.
Requirements
The integration is designed for IPfolio trademark customers who use CompuMark trademark watch products.
CompuMark Requirements
The IPfolio integration requires an active CompuMark account.
âª If you can create and view CompuMark trademark watches in SERION manually, we can configure the
integration.
âª If you arenât a CompuMark customer or otherwise canât create and view watches in SERION, please contact
CompuMark first.
IPfolio Requirements
Once your CompuMark account is ready, we do additional configuration in IPfolio. For example:
âª We connect IPfolio to your CompuMark account.
âª We adjust Trademark and Trademark Family page layouts, and more.

Ordering a Trademark Watch
Our trademark watch integration lets you create, edit, and view trademark watches directly from IPfolio trademark
and trademark family records.
Important: Please contact CompuMark if you inadvertently submit the watch order form or send conflicting
requests.
1. Navigate to a trademark or trademark family record.
More info: The watch is based on the mark name. Since the mark name is the same on the trademark
family record and all trademark records in the family, you can create a watch from any record in the family.
Watches you create appear on all records in the family.
2. Click Order Watch.
3. In the Order Details window, enter the required values:
a. Select the required CompuMark Trademark Watch Product (on page 329).
b. Specify the trademark and International Classes. (These are auto-populated by default.)
c. Indicate how to manage Identicaltrademarks in other classes.
d. Click Next.
Page 395
| 9 - IP Data Synchronization
4. In the Additional info window:
a. Specify the watch order Start date.
b. Enter more information or instructions to CompuMark in the Additional Instructions box.
c. Click Next.
5. In the Select countries/Regions/Registers window, select the jurisdictions where CompuMark should
watch, and then click Next.
â¦ Use the Simplified view to select by region.
â¦ Use the Detailed view for greater control of country selections.
6. In the Summary, review the values to ensure accuracy (you can expand Countries to review selected
countries.) When you have finished, click Submit.
Watch Order records appear in the Watch Orders related list on all trademarks in the family. Each time you
submit or resubmit a watch order, IPfolio creates an Email with the watch order details. This Email is then sent to
CompuMark, In-House Counsel (or to the record owner if the In-House Counsel is empty), the currently logged
in user, and the organization's own Email address. The Email is also added to the Documents section of the watch 
order record.
You can edit an existing watch order in SERION.
Reviewing Watch Results
With the IPfolio integration, you continue to use the CompuMark online platform to review trademark watch
results.
Features:
âª Access powerful filtering and sorting tools, plus POCA similarity scoring.
âª Prioritize actions with the innovative Opposition Dashboard, showing the days to opposition for each mark
cited.
âª Export and email key findings to outside counsel and share results with colleagues using online collaboration
tools.
1. Navigate to SERION and select Watch Results from the Watch tab.
More info: You can go to SERION directly, or click the link in SERION email notifications.
2. Review watch results. SERION displays all watch results in a common list.
More info: You can sort and filter the list as needed. For example, to see watch results grouped by the
CompuMark Trademark Watch product that produced them, filter or sort on the âProductâ column.
3. Set the Status of individual watch result records.
More info: By default, when you set the Status of a SERION watch result to Opposition, IPfolio creates a 
conflict record and a third party trademark record, and auto-populates the third party trademark.
Defining SERION Statuses that Trigger Record Creation
You can change which SERION watch result statuses trigger IPfolio record creation.
By default, the integration automatically creates IPfolio Conflict and Third Party Trademark records when you set
the Status of a SERION watch result to âOppositionâ.
You can change this default behavior, by customizing the Status picklist values in SERION (see the SERION 
documentation for details), and by changing which SERION watch result statuses trigger IPfolio record creation
(described below).
Page 396
IPfolio User Guide
1. Open the Admin panel in IPfolio.
2. Select CompuMark from the Data Feed tab (Admin Panel > Data Feed > CompuMark).
3. Enter the SERION status values that should trigger IPfolio record creation in SERION Statuses for Watch
Retrieval.
IPfolio Records Created from Watches
The integration monitors SERION and creates IPfolio records when you set the Status of a SERION watch result to 
Opposition (or another status that you have defined).
The integration automatically creates an IPfolio Conflict (on page 356) record.
In addition, the integration automatically creates an IPfolio Third Party Trademark record. IPfolio:
âª Creates a Third Party Trademark record.
âª Populates the newly created Third Party Trademark record using CompuMark Sync (on page 320).
âª Auto-populates the Opposition Deadline field on the newly created Third Party Trademark record using the
Watch Order Sync.
âª Relates the record to the corresponding Conflict record.
IPfolio Watch Order Record
IPfolio creates Conflict and Third Party Trademark records for specified watch results regardless of how you
ordered the watch. However, the integration wonât create the IPfolio records without a matching watch order 
record (on page 326). It looks for a matching watch order record. If it canât find one, it creates one.
âª If you created the watch request in IPfolio, the IPfolio watch order record already exists.
âª If you created the watch request in SERION, the IPfolio watch order record doesnât exist, so it creates one.
Note: A SERION watch result and IPfolio watch order match when the SERION Watched value equals the 
IPfolio Mark Name value. We âconnectâ the records by copying the SERION CompuMark Order Id value 
into the IPfolio Watch Order CompuMark Order Number field.

Chapter 10. Docketing
You can manage your portfolio using such automated docketing solutions as DocketEngine, Incoming
Correspondence module, Advanced Task Management, and E-Submission service (currently only supported for the
JPO and INPIT).
DocketEngine
DocketEngine is IPfolioâs automated docketing solution.
DocketEngine combines PTO data with highly structured country prosecution rules to open and close docket tasks,
track and trigger extensions, and monitor prosecution activities.
DocketEngine:
âª Monitors patent and trademark records,
âª Compares them to DocketEngine rules,
âª Runs matching rules to docket tasks, extensions, and de-docket as needed.
At the heart of DocketEngine is our cloud-based rules engine. DocketEngine rules are automatically updated. You
can edit or disable existing rules, and even create your own rules.
DocketEngine is flexible. Rules can be triggered when updating bibliographic fields, adding documents, docketing
actions and more.
Importantly, DocketEngine works the same regardless of how records are updated. When used with IPsync (or
similar services), DocketEngine auto-dockets as data arrives. We also run daily checks to auto-advance deadlines.
Actions and Tasks
DocketEngine automatically creates Actions and Tasks to monitor your prosecution work.
Actions represent correspondence from the patent office, for example, a Notice of Allowance, Notice of Missing
Parts, or Rejection. Actions for US applications are added automatically for IPsync customers. Actions for other
jurisdictions are added manually.
Tasks are something you do, and are typically created automatically via rules that trigger from actions or other
tasks. Auto-generated tasks always have calculated due dates. You can create a task manually by picking a task from
the New Task list and providing a due date. Available tasks are filtered by matter type and country.
Page 404
IPfolio User Guide
Automatically Generated Actions and Tasks
DocketEngine automatically generates actions and tasks, calculates due dates, and creates both statutory and
internal deadlines.
When a new action is received, DocketEngine calculates due dates and creates tasks based on the action.
DocketEngine creates tasks for both statutory deadlines like Pay Issue Fee, and internal deadlines like Review
Notice of Allowance. The task list can be sorted by Action/Task Name, Final Due Date, or any heading you find
helpful.
Below is an example of an action captured from Patent Center Private View (former Private PAIR) via IPsync, and
the resulting tasks generated from the action.
Note: Tasks generated from actions can be customized. While we do not change the base rules, we can
create additional custom rules. You can also deactivate rules for items you choose to not docket.
Docketers can work directly in the Prosecution Activities section by clicking For Review and adding comments.
Manually Managing Actions and Tasks
Processes can also be handled when they're not managed automatically.
Entering Actions
There are multiple methods available for manually entering actions.
Page 405
| 10 - Docketing
1. Select New Action from the Prosecution Activities section.
2. Click Action Type Name to get a drop-down of all possible actions.
3. Optional:
Type a keyword and IPfolio will filter the list. For example, to enter a Notice of Allowance type All.
4. Optional: Action Date can also be entered, which in this example is the âmailing dateâ of the action (as set
by the patent office).
5. Optional: If you received a corresponding document from outside counsel or the patent office, that
document can be uploaded to your Action.
6. Optional: You can also flag the action for review with comments for other team members.
Result: When the new action is saved, DocketEngine calculates due dates and creates tasks based on the
action you entered.
Entering Tasks
There are multiple methods available for manually entering tasks.
1. Select New Task from the Prosecution Activities section.
2. Press Space in Subject to see all available tasks.
Page 406
IPfolio User Guide
3. Optional: Type a portion of the task name to filter the drop-down list.
4. You can create your own task names as needed.
Updating Tasks
You have the option to manually update your Tasks and change the status of your Tasks.
1. Open the Patent you want to update.
2. Navigate to the Docket tab.
3. Select the Task to be updated.
4. Click the link under Task Status to open the Update Task window.
5. Update existing tasks as per your requirements.
Result: If the status Completed is selected, the completion date automatically updates with the date 
on which the status Complete was set. Vice versa, if a Completion Date is entered, the Status changes to 
Completed.
History Tracking for Activities
This functionality enables the tracking of the history of tasks and events. To make use of this feature, Salesforce 
Shield is required.
Further information can be retrieved here:
âª Salesforce Shield Official page
Task Owner Updates
When updating the owner of a Task, the owners of all open Tasks associated with this Task get updated
automatically to reflect this change.
This is currently supported by:

DocketEngine Rules
DocketEngine is backed by a cloud-based country rules library. The rules define specific procedures for each country
and IP record type.
Rules have âConditionsâ and âOutcomesâ:
âª Conditions determine if the rule should run.
âª Outcomes list the steps taken when the conditions are met.
DocketEngine monitors all changes, and when a ruleâs conditions are met, the rule is run.
Rules can be triggered by:
âª Changes to bibliographic fields
âª Documents from PAIR
âª Actions
âª Tasks
âª Renewals
Rules can be set to run:
âª Only once,
âª Every time a record is created or updated,
âª Daily. (âDailyâ rules are used to advance deadlines.)
DocketEngine Rules contain three sections - Content (on page 408), Conditions (on page 409) and Outcomes (on
page 409).
Content
The Content section manages the fields to be included in DocketEngine Rules.
Content fields determine:
Page 408
IPfolio User Guide
âª Which records the rule applies to.
âª How the rule is triggered.
âª When the rule is run.
Content Fields
See Field Library - Rule (on page 822) for related fields.
Conditions
Conditions enables you to determine attributes of DocketEngine Rules.
Conditions list one or more attributes that must be true for the rule to run. Indicate the âlogical groupingâ of 
multiple conditions in the Condition Format field in the Content section above.
In this example, conditions â1 AND 2â must be true for the record to be considered a match. This format is similar to
the âFilter Logicâ used in Salesforce Reports.
Outcomes
Outcomes describe the steps taken when the conditions are met.
Outcomes can:
Page 409
| 10 - Docketing
âª Create new Actions and Tasks.
âª Update existing Tasks and IP Rights.
âª Create and update renewal/maintenance records.
In this example:
âª A new task called âFile Non-Provisional Applicationâ is created and the Base Date is set.
âª The Due Date is set.
âª The Final Due Date is set.
Note: Using three outcomes to create a task and set the dates this way is common.
Another way of thinking of Outcomes: They are what show on your docket.
Prevention of Duplicate Actions and Tasks
DocketEngine rules run every time a record is saved. To avoid creating duplicates, DocketEngine checks if an action
or task exists before creating a new one.
A special field called Unique Compound Key is used to check for duplicates. Unique Compound Key combines three 
field values to uniquely identify an action or task. We create Unique Compound Key as follows:
Actions:
âª Subject + Id (of the related record) + Action Date
âª For example, âApplication Filing Date|a0L3s00000PGoQC123|2020-09-16â
Page 410
IPfolio User Guide
Tasks:
âª Action Type Name + Id (of the related record) + Due Date
âª For example, âFile Request for Examination|a0L3s00000PGoQC123|2020-10-16â
When a record is saved:
âª DocketEngine rules run.
âª We check the Unique Compound Key of existing actions and tasks.
âª We create new actions and tasks as needed, skipping those that already exist.
Prevention of Duplicate Renewals
To avoid creating duplicates, DocketEngine checks if Renewals exist before creating new ones.
A special field called Unique Compound Key is used to check for duplicates on Renewals and TM Renewals. Unique 
Compound Key combines four field values to uniquely identify a Renewal. We create Unique Compound Key as 
follows:
Subject + Id (of the related record) + Action Date + Payment Service Unique ID
Example for a Unique Compound Key: Annuity 5|a1pRK00000Ae6NVYAZ|2025-01-28|
eba34420-959f-48ae-9d8a-9e5f6ee77f8d
When a Renewal is received from Clarivate Renewals and matches an existing record, the Payment Service Unique
ID is populated. This triggers an update of the Unique Compound Key, ensuring data integrity and preventing
conflicts during the Renewal process.
Rules Management
DocketEngine rules are flexible. You can edit rules, disable rules, and create your own rules.
Customers manage their docket differently. Some docket common deadlines only. Others docket all office actions
(and the resulting deadlines). Still others docket differently by jurisdiction.
List Views and Reports
DocketEngine rules are simply records (in the Rule object).
As with all records, you can:
âª Create custom List Views (on page 157) to work with specific subsets of rules.
âª Create Reports (on page 496) to analyze existing rules.
âª Use Global Search (on page 152) to quickly find rules.
Common views and reports:
âª By Matter Typeââ Set Matter Type (on page 824) filter to âPatentâ or other.
âª By Jurisdiction â Set Jurisdiction (on page 823) filter to âUSâ or other.
âª Custom Rules â Set Rule Id (on page 824) filter to empty.
Page 411
| 10 - Docketing
Deactivating a Rule
Disabling a rule prevents calculating deadlines and adding them to your docket.
1. Find and open the rule.
2. Deselect Active (on page 822).
3. Select Do not update (on page 823) (to prevent the rule from re-activating during updates).
4. Add a dated comment in Notes (on page 824).
Customizing a Rule
It is possible to customize and adapt existing DocketEngine rules
1. Find and open the rule.
2. Make desired adjustments (for example, change conditions or add outcomes).
3. Select Do not update (on page 823) (to prevent the rule from re-activating during updates).
4. Add a dated comment in Notes (on page 824).
Creating a Custom Rule
It's important to follow certain best practices when creating rules.
1. Review existing rules before creating new rules.
2. Consider whether to modify an existing rule or create a new rule.
3. Create fewer rules that do more (instead of creating many highly specific rules).
4. Be consistent.
Example
An example for a 3 month reminder rule for US Provisionals.
âª Find a similar rule to emulate.
âª Go to the Rules object, and click New.
âª Copy rule settings from the existing rule to the new rule, making adjustments as needed.

Incoming Correspondence (Smart Docketing)
The Incoming Correspondence module - sometimes also referred to as Smart Docketing module - is not a standard
module of IPfolio. It needs to be activated and configured per customer.
Page 414
IPfolio User Guide
Introduction
If fully automatic docketing via the DocketEngine is not possible or desired in your company, IPfolio offers a
variable degree of manual review steps you can add to your docketing processes - especially for reviewing incoming
documents and data before taking them over into an IP case.
Incoming correspondence in IPfolio can come into the system via three different main channels:
âª IPsync
âª Email
âª PTO
A banner will inform you whenever documents or tasks are being processed. Upon successful completion of
calculations, you will receive a notification message.
Incoming correspondence typically comes from PTOs, inventors, and law firms, in the form of documents and data.
The field Source of Creation, which is available for every incoming document, indicates the external data source
from which the document was retrieved (e.g."IPsync/PAIR"). This information is updated by TDS/IP1D.
Document Management
This section covers list views, bulk processing, creating, importing and updating documents in connection with
Smart Docketing.
Accessing Incoming Correspondence
IPfolio provides configurable inboxes in the form of card tiles on your Home page.
Depending on your system configuration, one or several inbox tiles can be available - e.g. grouped by document
source, responsible inbox team, document status, etc.
Clicking on one of the tiles will take you to the corresponding list view.
Document List Views
After clicking on an inbox tile or opening the Documents tab from the IPfolio header, your are taken to the
corresponding document list view.
Should the list view still be displayed as Table, make sure to switch to Split View - so you can benefit from optimized
navigation and document handling.
Page 415
| 10 - Docketing
You can now click on a specific list item to view the corresponding document details and preview, or you can
navigate through the list using < Previous Item and NextItem > in the document header.
Bulk Processing Incoming Correspondence List View
It is possible to update multiple items at once from the Incoming Correspondence list view.
Depending on your system configuration, several bulk actions might be available directly in the list view:
Tip: Should you be missing one or several of the bulk actions described below, please ask your system
administrator to add them to the List View Button Layout of the Document object.
Creating Documents Manually
One or more document records can be created from scratch.
1. Go to the action menu in the list view and select New.
Result: A dialog opens.
2. Enter the Document details.
3. Click Save to create the new Document item.
4. Optional: Click Save & New to create the item and immediately start creating another one.
Page 416
IPfolio User Guide
Importing Documents
The import wizard enables users to import documents via CSV files.
1. Go to the action menu in the list view and select Import.
Result: The Salesforce import wizard opens.
2. Select the suggested custom object Documents.
3. Select the desired action (add new records, update existing records, or both).
4. Enter the required data.
5. Drag the CSV file into the defined location.
6. Click Next.
7. Follow the instructions of the import wizard.
Bulk-Changing Document Owners
In the list view one or several document owners can be changed.
1. Activate the checkboxes of the documents you want to assign to a new owner.
2. Select Change Owner from the list view menu.
Result: A dialog opens.
3. Deactivate the Send notification email checkbox if you do not want the new owner to be notified about
this change.
4. Click Submit.
The owner of the selected documents is changed.
Bulk-Discarding Documents
If certain documents should not be docketed, these documents can be discarded in list view.
1. Activate the checkboxes of the documents to be discarded. Mind that email messages and attachments are
listed individually in the list view - and therefore must also be selected and processed individually.
2. Select Discard from the list view menu.
Result: A confirmation screen opens, providing a list of all selected documents, including some key data
and links to the matched IP cases. Should one or more documents not fulfill the necessary requirements 
for discarding (e.g. because related data audits have already been processed), an according error message
will be displayed.
3. Check the list.
4. Click Confirm.
The documents are discarded and will no longer be considered for docketing. Their item status changes from
Matched to Case to No Docketing Required.
Tip: Documents can also be discarded individually in the incoming document view - for details, see 
Discarding Documents (on page 418).
Bulk-Docketing Documents
If the necessary requirements for docketing are fulfilled and one or more documents from the list view have already
been reviewed, these documents can be docketed in one go.
1. Activate the checkboxes of the documents to be docketed. Mind that email messages and attachments are
listed individually in the list view - and therefore must also be selected and processed individually.
2. Select Docket from the list view menu.
Page 417
| 10 - Docketing
Result: A confirmation screen opens, providing a list of all selected documents, including some key data
and links to the matched IP cases. Should one or more documents not fulfill the necessary requirements 
for docketing, an according error message will be displayed.
3. Revise the selected documents.
4. Repeat the steps above.
5. Click Confirm.
All selected documents fulfilling the necessary requirements are docketed and according follow-up actions will be
triggered. Documents NOT fulfilling the requirements are NOT docketed. They will remain unchanged by the bulk
action.
For details on a documentâs requirements for docketing, as well as on potential follow-up actions, please see
Completing the Review (on page 418).
Processing Incoming Documents
Depending on a documentâs type and status, different actions can be available in the Incoming Document view for
reviewing the new document and amending the suggested tasks and due dates to be triggered by it.
Note: The document preview is available for the file types .docx, .pdf, .ppt, .pptx, .xls, .xlsx, .gif, .jpg, and .png.
Please mind that it is NOT available for .msg and .eml files, since email preview is only supported for
emails received via IPfolio Email functionality, and not for those uploaded from Outlook.
In the Notes section it is possible to enter docketing-related comments or instructions. Also, docketing-related
system messages will be displayed here - e.g. in case of failed auto-docketing. Docketing notes will NOT be available
in the matched case after the document has been processed and docketed.
Setting or Changing Document Definitions
Each incoming document is assigned a Document Definition based on the Country Code and Official Document 
Code received from Clarivateâs DocketEngine.
Smart Docketing must be enabled.
Page 418
IPfolio User Guide
1. Open the document record.
2. Click Set Definition in the header section.
Result: A dialog opens.
3. Search for the Document Definition to be assigned to the document, e.g. based on its code or description, 
and select it from the drop-down.
4. Click Save.
The document data is updated based on the selected Document Definition (for example Document Title, Document
Code, Document Type).
In case the assignment has failed or is incorrect, the Document Definition can be changed manually in the incoming 
document view - provided that the document has not yet been docketed.
Note: Mind that the change of Document Definition might also cause the overall docketing process
(including follow-up tasks) and the document status to change, depending on the general handling defined in
the selected Document Definition.
Document Status
Documents can have various states in IPfolio.
Item Status Description
Received Initial Default Status
Matched to Case Document was matched to corresponding IP case - either automatically or manually
Review Document is being reviewed by a second reviewer (4-eye review)
Auto-Docketed Document was matched to case and automatically processed and docketed
Processed and 
Docketed
Document was matched to case and manually processed and docketed
No Docketing Required
There was a deliberate decision to take no further action on the document; document can be
matched or unmatched
Related information

Displayed Documents in Document Tree
When Smart Docketing is enabled, only specific documents are displayed in the document tree.
Table: Displayed documents in documenttree
Smart Docketing Enabled Smart Docketing Disabled
All documents with the Document Type Official and in the Document Status Processed and Docketed or Auto-Docketed.
All documents are visible, regardless of their 
Document Type or Document Status.
All documents where the Document Type is not Official.
Unmatching Documents
If the case the document was matched to (displayed next to the document name in the header section) is not correct,
you can unmatch it.
Page 419
| 10 - Docketing
As IPfolio automatically tries to match every received document to its corresponding IP case, the most probable
review status for users is Matched to Case. This is the only status in which the Case Information section in the 
document can be edited.
To unmatch a document in the status Matched to Case:
1. Open the document record.
2. Click Unmatch in the top right corner of the screen.
The document is now in the status Received again.
Note: Documents can only be unmatched as long as no Data Audits triggered by the document have been
accepted in the original case match. Any open Data Audits in the Review needed section of the document 
will simply be updated accordingly after the rematch.
Matching/Rematching Documents
It is possible to relate a document to a specific record.
The document has to be in the status Received.
1. Select the document you want to assign to a specific record.
2. Click Overview.
3. Under Case Information, search for the Record Id of the Patent record you want to match the document
to.
4. Click Relate To Case. The document is matched to the case. The item status changes to Matched to Case.
The document is assigned to the selected record.
Discarding Documents
Incoming documents or data contained therein that should not be docketed can be discarded entirely.
Discarding is only possible as long as no Data Audits have yet been accepted for the document.
1. Open the document record.
2. Click Discard in the top right corner of the screen.
Page 420
IPfolio User Guide
The document is now in the status No Docketing Required.
Tip: It is also possible to discard one or several documents directly in the document list view. For details, see
Bulk-Discarding Documents (on page 414).
Dispatching Documents (Changing the Owner)
Sometimes documents should remain unassigned or the owner needs to be changed after an initial owner 
assignment based on the system rules.
Note: A change of owner is only possible in the document status Received or Matched to Case. After that, the 
document owner is read-only.
1. Open the document record.
2. Click Dispatch To in the top right corner of the screen.
Result: A dialog opens.
3. Search for the name of the desired IPfolio user or user group and select them from the drop-down.
4. Optional: Activate the checkbox Send notification email if you want them to receive a notification email.
5. Optional: In case the document is an email (with attachments), activate the checkbox Also dispatch 
attachments if you want to change the owner of all email attachments.
6. Click Dispatch To again.
The document is now assigned to the new owner.
Sending Documents to 4-Eye Review
A document type can be defined to require at least two different users to review the incoming document before it is
docketed.
If this is the case, only a Send to Review button will be available to the first reviewer instead of the Docket button.
1. Open the document record.
2. Click Send to Review in the header section of the document view.
Result: A dialog opens.
3. Search for the name of the desired reviewer or reviewer queue and select them from the drop-down.
4. Define if you want them to receive a notification email.
5. Click Send to Review again.
The document is now pending to be reviewed by the second reviewer. Its Item Status is Review.
Completing the Review
All necessary conditions have to be met before docketing a document to update its status and integrate it into the
related IP case.
The following conditions must be met in order to complete a review:
âª A Document Definition and Document Date must be set.
âª The Item Status must be Matched to Case.
âª All Data Audits must be processed and saved (status Data Audit Done or No Discrepancies). For details, see
Processing Incoming Data and Tasks (on page 422) and Processing Email Attachments (on page 426)).
Page 421
| 10 - Docketing
1. Open the document record. For the Docket button to be available (and not grayed out), all of the
conditions listed above must be met.
2. Click Docket in the top right corner of the screen. The Item Status of the document changes to Processed 
and Docketed and the document view is now read-only.
The document is now listed in the Documents section of the related IP case, the incoming case data is updated 
accordingly, and any related tasks and due dates are created in the system.
Tip: It is also possible to docket one or several documents directly in the document list view. For details, see
Bulk-Docketing Documents (on page 414).
Cloning Documents
Documents can be cloned to be available in additional IPfolio records.
Cloning is possible in the following Item Status:
âª Received
âª Matched to Case
âª Processed and Docketed
Note: Email attachments can either be cloned in the email document they were received with (together
with all other attachments received at the time), or they can be opened and cloned individually.
A confirmation dialog is displayed, listing the cloned documents (or any errors that might have occurred) as well as
the selected IP Rights, and also providing links for quick and easy access.
1. Open the document record.
2. Click Clone in the document header.
Result: A dialog opens.
3. Search for the IP Right (or several IP Rights) you want the document to be cloned to.
4. Select it/them by activating the corresponding checkboxes in the results list.
5. When cloning documents that are already in the status Processed and Docketed, the default behavior is
that the status is set back to Matched to Case.
6. Optional: When cloning documents that are already in the status Processed and Docketed, you can define
if you also want the cloned document(s) to be in this final status (by activating the Keep CurrentItem
Status checkbox).
7. Click Clone in the button bar.
The document is cloned to the selected IP Rights.
Processing Incoming Data and Tasks
Depending on the type and status of an incoming document, the contained IP data as well as related tasks (and due 
dates) might have to be reviewed.
Accepting/Discarding Received Data
In case the system finds open Data Audits for a matched document a review and a decision is required.
If the system finds data that would be added or updated by docketing the incoming document, Data Audits will be
created. These Data Audits are displayed in a Review needed table at the top of the document view. For each item,
you can decide to either
Page 422
IPfolio User Guide
âª Accept the change and take it over to the IP case, or to
âª Discard the change.
If it is not necessary to decide on individual items, you can also use the available bulk actions:
âª To accept all suggested data changes and due date calculations listed in the Review needed section, click Accept 
All in the Data Audits row.
âª To discard all suggested data changes or due date calculations listed in the Review needed section, click Discard 
All in the Data Audits row.
If data is discarded, the status of the data audit changes to Discarded and the proposed information will NOT be
taken over to the case. If all data is accepted, the information will be taken over to the case once you have proceeded
with Docketing.
After all Data Audits have been processed, the table heading changes from Review needed to Data Audit Done. If 
no Data Audits were found at all for a document (and related case), the information No Discrepancies is displayed.
Amending Due Dates
In the Task section, you have the possibility to amend the tasks and related due date(s) suggested by the
DocketEngine.
1. Select the pencil icon next to the row of the date you wish to amend.
2. A calendar widget will open on screen for you to select a new date.
3. Once amended, the new date will be shown in the task list for a final review.

| 10 - Docketing
Reviewing Due Dates
In the Task section, you have the possibility to review the tasks and related due date(s) suggested by the
DocketEngine.
Note: If dates are discarded, the status of the data audit changes to discarded and the proposed information 
will NOT be taken over to the case. If all dates are accepted, the information will be taken over to the case
once you have Completed the Review and Docketed the Document (on page 418).
1. Navigate to the Review needed section.
2. The Data Audits shown to you will state what date field needs reviewing.
3. You can Accept or Discard the date provided.
4. Optional: Accept All and Discard All are also options available to use.
E-Correspondence
IPfolioâs E-Correspondence widget enables you to upload PTO packages and have their contents extracted and
processed via Clarivateâs Private Data Services (PDS).
After processing, the contained documents and bibliographic data should be ready for docketing with the matching
IP case.
Note: Please note that the E-Correspondence widget can only be used by customers using IPsync. It can
also be used independently of Smart Docketing by adding the widget to any page layout in IPfolio. Currently,
the widget supports the processing of ZIP files from the Japan Patent Office (JPO), PDF files from the World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO - PCT only) and PDF files from the European Patent Office (EPO).
Please also see Supported PCT Documents (on page 426) for further information. The upload of other PTO
correspondence will be supported in the future.
Uploading New PTO Correspondence
Uploading PTO Correspondence is easy, fast, and intuitive.
1. Navigate to the Upload PTO Correspondence widget (heading can vary) on your Incoming Document
screen. Click on it.
Result: The Upload Screen opens in the currently opened browser window.
2. Make sure the correct Patent Office is selected.
3. Drag and drop the desired PTO package(s) from your mailbox or the PTO application itself into the Drag
and drop or browse for files (.zip) area. You can upload up to 100 packages containing one file at a time.
4. Optional: Alternatively, you can also click the area to browse for the file(s) to be uploaded.
Page 424
IPfolio User Guide
You will receive feedback that your package(s) are being uploaded.
The following processing steps will be carried out:
âª The package file will be scanned for viruses (Scan Status is Pending). If the scan fails, the process stops.
âª As soon as the Scan Status changes to Clean, the actual processing starts and the status (and outcome) are
indicated in the Status column of the corresponding table row.
âª In case the service does not return the necessary data after multiple attempts, a Restart button will become 
available. Clicking this button will restart the attempts to fetch the missing data.
âª Bibliographical Data is extracted.
âª If a scan could not be completed (due to an error or when the process is still in progress), the affected row is still
being displayed with the current status visible.
âª After successful processing, the Status changes to Process Complete. The document upload record 
automatically disappears and can subsequently be found in the Show Complete view. See also Showing 
Completed PTO Correspondence (on page 425).
âª The extracted documents will be listed as PDF files in separate rows below the package files. The PDF files are
added to IPfolio.
âª The PDF files are automatically assigned to the corresponding case based on a Matching Algorithm. If no match 
is found, the file must be assigned manually.
âª If there are discrepancies between the Bibliographic Data returned by the Service and Bibliographical Data on
the respective case, Data Audits will be created. You can then Accept or Discard the proposed changes.
Showing Completed PTO Correspondence
After completing the document upload, documents can be found in the Show Completed tab.
To display completed documents:
Activate Show Completed in the upper right corner of the display.
All completed document uploads are displayed. Click on a document upload row to view the included PDFs.
Archiving List Entries
Processed entries from the list can be hidden and archived.
This will have no effect on the processed document(s) and data.
1. Navigate to the corresponding table row.
2. Click the Archive icon to the very right.
Result: The corresponding table row(s) are hidden.
âª To display archived packages at a later time, activate the Show Archived button.
âª To display completed rows at a later time, activate the Show Completed button.
Document Visibility: Admin Mode and User Mode
The visibility of uploaded documents to certain users can be restricted.
Page 425
| 10 - Docketing
The E-Correspondence widget utilizes two display modes:
âª Admin Mode:
âª In this mode, users can see all uploaded documents within the widget. This mode is automatically applied for 
IPfolio Admin Users.
âª User Mode:
âª This mode restricts visibility to documents uploaded by the user and is applied for regular users.
Supported PCT Documents
The service currently supports these documents:
Acknowledgement of receipt of request - OLF EPA (PCT/RO/101)
Communication to Designated Offices which apply the 30 month period
Communication to Designated Offices which do not apply the 30 month time limit (PCT/
IB/308)

Written opinion of the international searching authority
Processing Email Attachments
Documents received as email attachments are generally listed as separate documents in the document list view and
can be handled and decided upon independently from the original email message. However, the detail view of the
original email (.msg file) will still provide an overview of all attachments received with this email, and will provide
various bulk actions for processing all or several attachments in one go.
The detail view for emails shows the subject of the email, followed by some key data (Sender/Recipient, CC, Date
Sent/Received, and Number of Attachments) in the header section. The Attachments table shows a list of all
attachments, including
âª Attachment Name (and preview upon hovering over the name),
âª Document Date,
âª current Item Status, and
âª Document Definition.
Here, the Dates and Document Definitions for individual attachments can be edited, and Discard decisions can be 
made. For details, see Processing Individual Attachments (on page 427) below.
In the top right corner of the Incoming Document screen, several bulk actions are available (depending on the
current document status) for the email itself and all attached documents.
Page 426
IPfolio User Guide
Bulk-Processing All Attachments
Emails and attachments can be managed in one go with certain prerequisites met.
The option Docket processes and dockets the email and all related attachments for which the following conditions
are fulfilled:
âª The Document Definition is set.
âª The Document Date is set.
âª The Item Status is Matched to Case.
âª There are no open Data Audits/Discrepancies on the matched IP case(s).
Send to Review: Sends all related attachments for which the above conditions are fulfilled but that require 4-eye
review to a selected reviewer. For further information, see Sending Documents to 4-Eye Review (on page 418).
Unmatch All: Processes the email and all related attachments by removing the relation to its Patent, moving the
documents to the Unmatched Emails folder, and setting the item status to Received.
Discard All: Processes the email and all related attachments by setting the Processed By and Processed On fields on
the attachments and setting their Item Status to No Docketing Required.
Note: Discarding is only possible as long as no Data Audits have yet been accepted for the documents.
Processing Individual Attachments
Emails and attachments can be managed individually as opposed to in bulk.
If you do not wish to docket, unmatch or discard all documents attached to an email, you can either open the
attachments individually from the document list view, or you can go to the Attachments table in the email itself 
and decide to discard or unmatch individual attachments or amend the assigned receipt dates and/or document 
definitions before docketing the email.
Note: Mind that individual attachments to the same incoming email can also be matched to different IPfolio 
cases. However, each attachment can only be matched to one case.
Unmatching Individual Attachments
Like any other document, email attachments can be unmatched as long as no Data Audits triggered by the
attachment have been accepted in the matched case.
Page 427
| 10 - Docketing
To unmatch an individual email attachment (and match it to a new case):
1. Open the email document.
2. Scroll down to the Attachment list.
3. Click on the file name of the attachment to be unmatched.
Result: The attachment opens as individual document.
4. Click Unmatch in the document header.
Result: The document is unmatched and its Item Status is set back to Received.
5. Enter the Record Id of the new IP case under Case Information.
6. Click Relate To Case.
Result: The attachment is matched with the new case. Its Item Status is again Matched to Case.
The attachment remains listed in the Attachment list of the original email (marked by a Match changed indicator), but 
will now be docketed with the new case match.
Amending Due Dates
Due Dates for all email attachments are shown in the Task section only once Docketing has been completed. These
due dates can then be amended if the calculation is not agreeable with you.
All suggestions for task owners (Assigned To) and due dates have been determined by the DocketEngine.
For more information, see Amending Due Dates in Reviewing Data and Tasks (on page 422).

Advanced Task Management
IPfolioâs Advanced Task Management (ATM) module allows for the configuration of workflows for specific tasks,
ensuring that everything necessary for task completion is in one place.
Introduction
Advanced Task Management is available for Patents, Patent Families, Trademarks, Trademark Search Requests and
Invention Disclosures.
Tasks and follow-up tasks are generated in the background. All the essential configurable properties of tasks are
located in one place. This in turn means, that existing workflows can be easily adapted to suit business process
changes or other modifications.
Example Task Flow
Task flows, which model simple to highly complex business processes, can be easily set up according to your needs in
IPfolio.
Note: The state of task flows is automatically saved - users can therefore leave tasks open and come back to
them at a later stage to complete a step.
For illustration purposes, let us have a look at an example task flow for handling 71(3) communication requests:
Page 432
IPfolio User Guide
Follow-Up Tasks
Depending on the choices the user makes in a task, follow-up tasks can be triggered or the task can be closed. It is
also possible to predefine task owners for specific tasks.
At the beginning of our example flow, we have two basic options:
âª If the 71(3) text is approved immediately, no follow-up tasks will be created and the task will be closed.
âª If the 71(3) text is not approved, follow-up tasks will be generated.
The follow-up tasks would show up in the corresponding navigation item as follows:
Page 433
| 10 - Docketing
The first follow-up task in our example flow is to choose either an in-house attorney or an external attorney to take
care of the new task. In the task window itself you can
âª choose between options
âª add files or
âª add comments
The actual options to be available in a task depend on the setup of the Advanced Task Management flow.
Beneath the follow-up tasks help texts pertaining to the various options are displayed.
In our example flow, the final task would be to send the amended and approved text to the PTO.
After the final task has been completed, the workflow is considered closed and the system notifies you that there
are no more open tasks.
Triggering Advanced Task Management
Advanced Task Management has to be triggered inside a task record.
Page 434
IPfolio User Guide
1. Go to a supported record entry.
2. Click on the task for which you want an ATM flow to be triggered.
3. Select Task Type under Task Information
4. Choose a Task Type based on a Task Definition (on page 435).
After choosing an ATM Task Type, the ATM flow will run based on the underlying Task Definition. You can then
select a Task Option and continue working on the Task flow as defined in the Task Option Definition.
Configuration Objects
The setup of Advanced Task Management depends on 3 objects.
These are most important objects for setting up an Advanced Task Management flow:
Task Definition:
Defines the Task Type and Task Owner Type.
Task Definition Follow-Up Tasks
âª Defines which Follow-Up Tasks are to be triggered when a specific Action was selected and/or a Task was
completed.
âª The Task object has a designated field set called Copy When Creating Follow-Up Tasks. When you create
Follow-Up Tasks, the fields within this field set are automatically copied from the original tasks into the newly
created Follow-Up Tasks.
Task Option Definition
âª Defines the options to be available to the Task Owner of a task (background information, option buttons,
document upload area, Category Tree, etc.â¦)
âª Important: Please note that task flows should only be set up and modified by experienced IPfolio
System Administrators or members of IPfolioâs Premium Service Team.
Administration
Document definitions, Document states, and Auto-Docketing are vital in managing docketed documents.
Document Definitions
The handling of an incoming document in IPfolio is largely defined by its assigned Document Definition. Document
Definitions are own record types in IPfolio.
Impact of Assigned Document Definition
Based on the Document Definition assigned to an incoming Document, the system defines the following details:
Page 435
| 10 - Docketing
âª the responsible Document Owner (person or team)
âª the importance of the document (1-5)
âª the Default Folder for placing the document in the related IP case
âª the Default Document Type (e.g. Official)
âª the Default Document Sub-Type (e.g. Filing Receipt, Office Action, etc.)
âª the handling of Discrepancies (automatic acceptance - yes or no)
âª and the general handling of the document
Document Handling & Status
IPfolio chooses default item states after the handling of documents.
The following handling types are distinguished:
Handling
Description Default Item Status 
after System Handling
Accept & 
Tweak
System tries to match incoming document and case, and to assign the document to 
the user or team responsible for review
Matched to Case
4-Eye
Review
Same as Accept & Tweak, plus additional review by at least one other user or
team
Matched to Case
Automatic
System tries to match, process and docket the incoming document and data fully 
automatically, provided that certain preconditions are met (for details, see below)
Auto-Docketed
Auto-Docketing
Auto-docketing can be configured via the Document Definition and is the method of documents being docketed
automatically by pre-set processes.
Auto-docketing can be applied to:
âª TDS
âª Email
âª E-correspondence
âª Upload
An incoming document can only be auto-docketed if it meets the following requirements:
âª A Document Definition is set.
âª The handling is set to Automatic.
âª A Date is set.
Page 436
IPfolio User Guide
âª The Item Status is Matched to Case.
âª There are no open discrepancies on its parent case.
If all the above requirements are met, the document is auto-docketed and its Item Status changes to Processed and 
Docketed.
If the document has open discrepancies, but the other criteria are fulfilled, auto-docketing can still proceed if the
Automatic Discrepancy Accept checkbox on the Document Definition object is active.
Automatic Discrepancy Acceptance
The Automatic Discrepancy Accept field is set on the Document Definition object and defines if a document should 
be auto-docketed even in case of detected discrepancies.
âª If the checkbox is active, any discrepancies detected via data audits will automatically be accepted during autodocketing.
âª If the checkbox is inactive (=default setting), open discrepancies will NOT be automatically accepted and the
document will NOT be auto-docketed. Instead, it will remain in its current status and receive the note Autodocketing failed due to open discrepancies.
Any docketing notes provided in the case of open discrepancies will be editable by users and placed in chronological
order. Once the document is docketed, the notes will become read-only, and they will only be displayed in the
Incoming Mail screen (not in the documentâs related case).
Creating New Document Definitions
IPfolio facilitates the creation of new Document Definitions in the App Launcher.
1. Search for Document Definition in the App Launcher.
2. Document Definition opens.
3. Click New.
4. Enter:
â¦ Country(Jurisdiction)
â¦ Document Code
â¦ Type of Right (select from Dropdown)
5. Click Save.
The Document Definition records is created. The Document Definition ID gets automatically generated based on
your input when creating a new Document Definition and follows the logic: Country/Jurisdiction-Document CodeType of Right.
The Document Definition ID for the following example would be AT-PDF0001-Trademark:

Chapter 11. Annuities / Renewals
IPfolio makes it easy to manage renewals directly on your IPfolio records.
Payment instructions are managed directly on IPfolio Patent and Trademark records â IPfolio sends payment
instructions to ipan using the âip-x-changeâ API, Renewal/Maintenance due dates and costs being automatically
added for the next 12 month period.
Thus, each month:
âª You review payment instructions for existing cases and provide instructions for new cases.
âª IPfolio sends payment updates to ipan nightly.
âª At the end of the month, ipan aggregates instructions for the month and performs a final review before making
payments.
âª IPfolio receives Renewal/Maintenance deadlines for the next 12 month period monthly or quarterly.
Key Fields and Records
There are several key fields and records to consider in terms of Annuities/Renewals.
The key Annuity/Renewal fields on Patents and Trademarks are Annuity/Renewal Fee Payer and Maintenance 
Status.
Renewal/Maintenance deadlines are stored separately in the Renewal/Maintenance object (for Patents) or TM
Renewals (for Trademarks.).
Page 440
IPfolio User Guide
Detailed status of ipan renewal payments is retrieved upon synchronization and displayed in the Service Status field 
on the Renewal/Maintenance and TM Renewal objects.
Important: For the Service Status field to function properly and reflect the status of ipan renewal payments,
your org needs to be connected to iHub.
Payment Instructions
Instructions can be given at either the case or Renewal/Maintenance level.
There are several points to be considered, as you choose for the payment instructions to be given at the case
(Patent/Trademark) or Renewal/Maintenance level.
âª The only fields that matter for payment instructions are Annuity/Renewal Fee Payer and Maintenance Status.
âª The simplest approach is to manage these fields directly on Patents and Trademarks.
âª For convenience, you can use the Pay field on Renewal/Maintenance records, but itâs important to understand 
that Pay doesnât send updates directly. Instead, Pay updates the Maintenance Status on the related Patent or
Trademark.
âª Always review the Annuity/Renewal Fee Payer and Maintenance Status for active cases carefully, since these
fields determine what will and wonât be paid.
Setting Payment Instructions on Cases
Most customers give instructions at the case level.
Case level instructions are given to the renewal service provider using the Maintenance Status field on the Patent
or Trademark record in accordance with the following combinations (with a prerequisite that Annuity/Renewal Fee
Payer = ipan):
Status (High-Level) Maintenance Status Payment Instruction
Pending/In Force Active Active
Lapsed/Sold/Closed Active Abandonment Instruction
Pending/In Force/Lapsed/Sold/
Closed
Inactive Abandonment Instruction
where
âª Active represents a 'Pay' instruction, and
âª Inactive constitutes a 'Donât Pay' one.
Page 441
| 11 - Annuities / Renewals
Note: Removal of ipan, or deletion of a case previously sent, will be treated as Abandonment Instruction.
Setting Payment Instructions on Renewal/Maintenance Records
While most customers give instructions at the case level, some track payment instructions at the individual
Renewal/Maintenance level, leveraging the Pay field found on Renewal/Maintenance records.
Using the Pay field to provide instructions at the renewal level works well, provided you understand the following:
âª Changing the Pay field doesnât trigger an ipan sync directly.
âª Changing the Pay field updates the Maintenance Status of the related Patent or Trademark, and that triggers a
sync with ipan.
When the Pay field changes:
âª If the Due Date of the Maintenance/Renewal record is in the past, ignore the Pay change and do not update 
Maintenance Status. (This enables data cleanup without manipulating Maintenance Status.)
âª In all other cases
âª If Pay = Yes, Maintenance Status will change to Active.
âª If Pay = No, Maintenance Status will change to Inactive.
The instruction period will be defined by the renewal services team and should always be related to the next future
renewal.
When divergent instructions are made on the same record, the most recent update determines the Maintenance 
Status of the entire case.
Renewal Decisions
Your goal is to ensure the Annuity/Renewal Fee Payer and Maintenance Status fields are set correctly on active
Patents and Trademarks.
Assuming Annuity/Renewal Fee Payer is set correctly, you can set the Maintenance Status either:
âª Directly on a Patent or Trademark, OR
âª Indirectly by setting the Pay field on related Renewals/Maintenance records.
Reviewing Renewals Due Next Quarter
You can make payment decisions for all upcoming renewals using the Renewals Due Next Quarter list view.
Page 442
IPfolio User Guide
1. Click the Renewals/Maintenance tab on the Navigation Bar. (TM Renewals for Trademarks).
2. Select the Renewals Due Next Quarter list view.
3. Select multiple renewals, then edit the Pay field for one. You will be asked
if you want to apply the new value to the current item or âall selected
itemsâ.
Family-wide Next Renewals Table
The Family-wide Next Renewals table (at the bottom of every Renewal/Maintenance record) is a convenient way to
make payment decisions for other members of the same family.
Note: (for System Administrators)
Use the Renewal Table Columns Field Set (on page 467) (Setup> Object Manager > TM Renewal> Field 
Sets > Renewal Table Columns and Setup> Object Manager> Renewal/Maintenance > Field Sets > 
Renewal Table Columns) to manage the table columns. To have payment instructions displayed, make sure
to add the Pay field to the Field Set on both objects.
Page 443
| 11 - Annuities / Renewals
Forecasting
So far, our focus has been on near-term payment decisions. But IPfolioâs powerful reporting features make longterm planning and forecasting possible too.
The key to reports is selecting the correct report type to start. The report type tells IPfolio which objects and fields
you want to include in the report.
To forecast renewal costs for patents, create a report of type Patents with Renewals/Maintenance. This tells IPfolio 
to focus on these two objects, making the fields from each available in your report. From there you can create any
number of custom reports, grouping by country, cost, or any other dimensions relevant to your renewal forecasts.

Integration with the ipan Renewal Service
Tracking and managing your renewals is enabled through the integration with the ipan Renewal Service.
Page 445
| 11 - Annuities / Renewals
âª IPfolio monitors Patent and Trademark records and sends relevant changes to ipan daily.
âª At the end of the month, ipan aggregates instructions for the month and performs a final review before making
payments.
âª IPfolio receives Renewal/Maintenance deadlines for the next 12-month period (or up to 99 months into the
future, as specified in your agreement with ipan) monthly.
Records Excluded from Transmission to the Renewal Service
Please be aware that there are cases where records will not be transmitted to the renewal service.
The following records are not eligible for transmission and will not be sent to the renewal service:
âª Patents and Trademarks
âª with Status (High-Level)=Not Filed.
âª with Annuity/Renewal Fee Payerâ ipan.
âª with Maintenance Status=Inactive.
âª whose Application Number is blank.
âª Trademarks whose Mark Name is blank.
Daily Changes
IPfolio monitors your Patent and Trademark records for changes to relevant fields, and sends updates to ipan daily
using the âip-x-changeâ API.
âª The fields that trigger a sync when changed are Maintenance Status and other key bibliographic fields.
âª You can also add custom fields/edit fields that trigger a sync via a specific field set.
âª The fields that are sent to ipan are listed here: Fields Exported to ipan (on page 449).
The Payment Service Sync Status and Last Payment Provider Sync fields (in the System Information section on 
Patents and Trademarks) show the sync status of the current record.
âª Payment Service Sync Status: New or Update indicate cases to be synced. Processed indicates a successful sync.
âª Last Payment Provider Sync: Shows the date and time of the last successful sync.
Monthly Payments
While IPfolio sends changes to ipan daily, updates are only processed by ipan at the end of the current month.
You can change payment decisions (or other key data) multiple times during the month. The value in place at the end
of the month is the value processed.
Note: Because ipan manually validates your data before making payments, there is a short âblackoutâ period
at the end of each month. Itâs best to review and finalize your data before this period every month. If you do
need to make changes during this time, make sure to confirm them with ipan separately.
Reminders
After making payments each month, ipan generates Renewal/Maintenance deadlines for the next 12 month period.

Managing Data Discrepancies
You can manage data discrepancies retrieved by the renewals data verification team directly in IPfolio â by
processing Data Audits, in the same way as with other IPfolio data feed services: Process Data Audits.
Important:
Data Audits that Require Manual Review
Generally, when you use Data Audit records to accept or discard discrepancies retrieved with the renewals
data verification service, updates happen automatically. However, there are cases where manual review is
required.
You can identify those by the 'Manual Review' prefix in the Field Name column in the Data Audits list view.
When trying to accept them â whether in bulk or individually â you will be prompted to manually review the
discrepancies on individual record pages.
This functionality is supported by an Admin Panel setting Additional Discrepancy Fields (Admin Panel > 
Integrations > Payment Service > Additional Discrepancy Fields), where the fields that require manual 
review can be stipulated. Its current default values are Case and Classes, additional values can be added in 
future.
Data Discrepancy Field Export
Based on the input in IPfolio (Accept, Discard - Reject, Discard - Ignore) data audit records in ipan get updated via
the ip-x-change (on page 440) API. Bulk updates are possible.

Document Downloading
Payment receipts can be directly downloaded into the IPAN folder within the document tree through scheduled
jobs.
This functionality can be disabled in the Custom Settings (please contact your System Administrator for details).
Daily Sync
The ipan API integration consists of three separate jobs that run daily.
âª Case Updates (ipan Case Renewal instructions)
âª Forecast Updates (ipan Forecast API updates Renewal/TM Renewal object with Projected Cost data)
âª Invoice Updates (ipan Invoice API updates Renewal/TM Renewal object with Actual Cost data and Invoice
Date)
Setup
Renewals can be enabled during initial IPfolio onboarding, or anytime thereafter.
Important: Please mind that for the proper end-to-end sync, configuration on both sides (IPfolio and ipan)
is required, so the setup process should be carried out in close cooperation with those responsible on ipan
side.
Setup on IPfolio side includes:
âª Data validation.
âª Setting payment instructions.
Data Validation
Key bibliographic data on included cases must be correct before payments can be processed. During the ipan
onboarding process, we work with you to ensure valid data.
ipan does not check all fields on all records. Instead, they validate relevant fields on included cases.
âª Relevant fields include Application Number, Filing Date, Relationship to Parent and other key bibliographic
data.
âª Included cases are those with annuities to be paid by ipan.
Setting Payment Instructions
During data validation, we will identify active cases and set the payment fields accordingly:
Page 448
IPfolio User Guide
âª Annuity/Renewal Fee Payer = ipan
âª Maintenance Status = Active
To reduce manual data entry and improve data integrity, we work with you to set default values for new records, 
too. The following are examples of common default values:

Trademark Maintenance Decisions
With IPfolio you can create a trademark renewal review cycle to get stakeholder feedback before making trademark
maintenance decisions.
Creating a schedule and gathering feedback manually is tedious and time consuming, especially for customers with 
large portfolios. The IPfolio automated trademark maintenance decision flow makes this process easier.
How It Works
The automated Trademark Maintenance Decision Flow moves the entire renewal review process âinto the systemâ
alongside your TM Renewal records.
Figure 58. Custom Review Cycle with 5 review phases
Preliminary TMR 
initiation
Attorney 
Renewal 
Decision
IP Liaison 
Review
Final attorney 
review
IP coordinator 
review
The administrator defines a custom review cycle with one or more review phases. Subsequently, the cycle IPfolio
will run daily and update the eligible TM at the start and end of each phase.
Stakeholders are notified by email at the start of a renewal phase, or when a reminder date is reached. The
stakeholders (attorneys, IP coordinators, etc.) can enter their feedback directly in the trademark renewal records.
When the renewal cycle reaches its conclusion, the docketing of corresponding trademark records in the IPMS is
updated according to the decisions taken. In IPfolio, the TM Renewal record is updated with a Pay instruction based 
on the final renewal decision (for Abandon, Pay is set to No, and for Renew Pay is set to Yes).

IPfolio User Guide
Figure 59. TM Renewal with Stakeholder Feedback
Trademark Renewal Review Setup
With IPfolio you can create a custom trademark renewal review workflow that matches your business needs.
The setup procedure creates a set of TM Renewal Phase records, each representing a phase of the review cycle.
Creating a Renewal Review Cycle
When you set up renewal phases, you need to define the frequency, number of phases, and person responsible for
each phase.
Page 453

Renewal due date offset [Months] Number of months after the start date for reviewing renewals. For example, if you enter 8 months,
then renewals which are due 8 months after the 
start date will be reviewed. The period runs according to the frequency of the renewal cycle. If you select an annual frequency, then the system will retrieve trademarks with a renewal due date in the 
12-month period following the start date + renewal 
due date offset.
3. For each phase (the number of which is determined by the Phases per review cycle setting), enter the 
required values.
Option Description

Enterprise Legal Management
ELM software helps your law department to both get work done as well as deliver data, reports, and analytics to
properly represent the team with executives and board members.
Overview
âª Most IP groups create a new record in their Enterprise Legal Management (or âe-Billingâ) system for each new IP
Right (billing âper matterâ.)
âª While creating and updating matters manually in the e-Billing system works for small portfolios, it becomes 
impractical as the portfolio grows.
âª IPfolioâs e-Billing integration automatically creates and updates matters for several leading ELM solutions.
âª Whenever a Patent or Trademark is created in IPfolio, or any changes to relevant fields are made (e.g. the Law
Firm), the corresponding matter in the ELM system is created or updated at the next full hour. The systems
communicate server-to-server, via a state-of-the-art web service integration, without any manual touch or
exporting/importing required.
âª This integration is currently available for SimpleLegal, Thomson Reuters Legal Tracker (formerly Serengeti), and 
Mitratech TeamConnect.
âª In the case of SimpleLegal, also an enhanced integration is available, allowing you not only to push, but also to
pull cost data from the ELM system and create according cost records.
Importing Cost Data
The enhanced SimpleLegal integration:
âª Creates individual Cost records.
âª Creates Invoice records/objects that group the Cost records.
âª Creates associated Party records as needed.
It requires the use of Invoice objects in IPfolio.
Setup
âª The integration requires an existing account with a compatible ELM system. We create a secure connection
between IPfolio and your ELM system.
âª We map key IPfolio fields to corresponding fields in your ELM. IPfolio data is passed to your ELM system when
IPfolio records are created or updated.
âª We make minor customizations to improve usability and data integrity. For example, if one person approves all
invoices, we might set the default value of the IPfolio Cost Approver field to that person.
âª You can specify the status of the invoices to be imported from SimpleLegal by selecting one of the values in the
Allowed Invoice Import Status field on the ELM tab of the Admin Panel (on page 512).
Page 470
IPfolio User Guide
âª Please mind that when the Write Null Values to SimpleLegal setting on the ELM tab of the Admin Panel
(on page 512) is active, field values in SimpleLegal are overwritten in the course of the sync process even
if the corresponding IPfolio fields are blank. So, before activating this checkbox, please make sure no valid
SimpleLegal content will be overwritten by null IPfolio values.
Key Fields
ID Fields
IPfolio records have a unique ID that is sent to your ELM system. Your ELM records have a unique ID
that is sent to IPfolio. The various ID fields are used to ensure the proper functioning of the system.
Required Fields
IPfolio integrates with several leading e-Billing systems. While field names vary from system-tosystem, they all have certain fields in common. For example, all have a âMatter Nameâ and âMatter
Numberâ (or some variation thereof.) During setup, we map IPfolio fields to their ELM equivalent in
your system.
Custom Fields
We can configure IPfolio to send data from other custom fields too. (The field names and types must
be the same in both systems. Adding custom fields is optional.)
API Status Fields
These fields indicate the sync status of a given record. For example, a check in the e-Billing Sync
Required field indicates IPfolio data has changed and a sync is pending.
How it Works
As you create and update IP Rights in IPfolio, the integration creates and updates corresponding billing matters in
your ELM system.
âª By default, changes in IPfolio are pushed to your ELM system hourly.
âª You can update an individual record by clicking Create/Update e-Billing Matter on the IP Right.
âª The e-Billing Sync Required field on IP Rights indicates whether the record is currently in the e-Billing system. 
You can define conditions based on which this field is updated.
The process is designed to be largely automated.
âª Paralegals, In-House Counsel, and other IP team members create and update IP Rights normally. IPfolio creates
and updates matters in the ELM system in the background.
âª Outside Counsel, annuity/renewal service providers, and other vendors log into the ELM system normally to
upload invoices and perform related tasks.
âª In-House Counsel and Accounts Payable log into the ELM system normally to approve invoices and perform
related tasks.
eSignature
Electronic signatures (eSignatures) facilitate the validation, authentication and management of electronic
agreements and allow for secure transmission of documents.
Page 471
| 12 - Integrations
With eSignature third-party-integrations you can create and send standard agreements for signatures, trigger
actions and track statuses. Store agreements on the original record and automate and connect the entire agreement
process.
Supported third-party integrations include:
âª AdobeSign
âª DocuSign
âª Conga
Innography
Innography correlates data with firmographic, litigation and patent valuation data, and provides powerful search
and analytics tools.
PortfolioIQ
PortfolioIQ is an Innography feature that lets you add private data to Innography.
Use PortfolioIQ to add private records like unpublished patent applications and invention disclosures to Innography,
and add private IPfolio fields to public and private records in Innography.
Page 472
IPfolio User Guide
Figure 67. Private IPfolio Data on a Public Innography Record
The IPfolio/PortfolioIQ integration makes it easy to:
âª Create private records in Innography.
âª Create and update IPfolio fields on public and private records in Innography.
Important: The integration sends IPfolio data to PortfolioIQ. It does not retrieve data from PortfolioIQ.
PortfolioIQ Requirements
âª An Innography subscription with a PortfolioIQ entitlement is required.
âª IPfolio connects to Innography at a system level. Additional individual licenses are not required.
âª Cost is based on the amount of data used in Innography.
PortfolioIQ Setup
Setting up the integration is straightforward. During setup, we:
âª Establish a secure connection between IPfolio and Innography.
âª Select the features to include (patents only, or patents and invention disclosures).
âª Select the IPfolio fields to add to Innography records.
âª Perform an initial data backfill in Innography, creating private records and adding IPfolio field data to
Innography records.
Once setup is complete, the IPfolio/PortfolioIQ integration is largely automated. The integration automatically:
âª Flags records to update in Innography as you work in IPfolio.
âª Creates private records in Innography.
âª Adds and updates IPfolio field data to public and private records in Innography.
âª Removes private records created by IPfolio when public records become available in Innography.
Patents
For patents, the IPfolio/PortfolioIQ integration creates private patent records for unpublished applications in
Innography, and adds and updates IPfolio field data to public and private patent records in Innography.
When public Innography records become available, private records created by IPfolio are removed.
Page 473
| 12 - Integrations
Figure 68. Private IPfolio Data on a Public Innography Record
How It Works
As you work in IPfolio we automatically flag records to sync with Innography. Broadly speaking, we flag new patent
records and existing patent records when relevant fields change.
We sync flagged records with Innography daily, creating or updating records in Innography. When we sync a flagged
record, the action we take depends on whether a public record exists in Innography.
âª If a public record exists, we add the IPfolio fields you specify.
âª If a public record doesnât exist, we create a private record in Innography, add Common Bibliographic Fields (on
page 475), and add the IPfolio fields you specify.
If IPfolio creates a private record in Innography and a public Innography record becomes available later, we update
the public Innography record with the IPfolio fields you specify and delete the private record created by IPfolio.
Reviewing IP One Sync Detail records may be helpful. Add the IP ONE Sync Details lookup field to the patent layout
or add it to patent reports to find sync details for specific patent records.
In summary, the PortfolioIQ integration:
âª Flags IPfolio records to sync as you work.
âª Updates existing public records in Innography with the IPfolio fields you specify.
âª Creates new private records in Innography adding common bibliographic fields and the IPfolio fields you specify.
âª De-duplicates private records when public records become available.
The Role of IP One Data
Innography and IPfolio are both tightly integrated with IP One data.
IP One Data is the source of Innography public records and IP One Data is used by IPfolio to validate public patent
records as part of our IPsync service.
We leverage our existing IP One Data integration to find matching records for PortfolioIQ.
âª First, we run an IP One Data Sync â the same sync we run when validating patent records with IP One Data. 
This matches IPfolio records with IP One Data records which is synonymous with matching Innography records.
âª We capture details of each match in our IP ONE Sync Detail records.
âª We then run the PortfolioIQ sync. We use IP One Sync Detail records to determine if a match exists, the quality
of the match, and more.

Invention Disclosures
The IPfolio/PortfolioIQ integration creates and updates private invention disclosure records in Innography.
Note: Creating invention disclosure records in PortfolioIQ is optional.
How It Works
The integration creates (or updates) an invention disclosure in Innography when the IPfolio record Status changes 
to âSubmitted for Reviewâ. The status of an IPfolio invention disclosure changes to âSubmitted for Reviewâ when:
âª An inventor first submits an invention disclosure.
âª An inventor responds to a Request for Information.
Page 475
| 12 - Integrations
When the integration runs, IPfolio checks for an existing private invention disclosure in Innography.
âª If a record doesnât exist, we create one.
âª If a record exists, we update it.

You can include text from other IPfolio fields by adding them to the Invention Description field set on
the Invention Disclosure object in IPfolio. This is typically done during setup.
Note: IPfolio does not create individual fields on the Innography record for every field in the
field set. Instead, IPfolio adds the combined text from the fields to the Abstract field of the 
Innography record.

Implementation Details
An Innography subscription with a PortfolioIQ entitlement is required. The cost is based on the amount of data used
in Innography.
Note: IPfolio connects to Innography at a system level. Additional individual licenses are not required.
IPfolio creates a secure connection to Innography during setup, with a series of API calls. IPfolio requests
permission to connect to Innography via the API, and you then accept the request from within Innography and 
provide us with relevant security information which we use to complete the setup in IPfolio.
Additional Field Details
IPfolio converts some data before adding it to Innography. IPfolio:
Page 476
IPfolio User Guide
âª Converts Rich Text fields to plain text.
âª Converts hierarchical fields (like Categories) to text lists.
âª Copies the Name of the record in Lookup field (instead of the Id) and converts Lookup fields to lists.
Setting up PortfolioIQ for Patents
You need to enable PortfolioIQ for patents, and select the IPfolio fields that you want to copy to Innography patent
records.
1. Select Enable Private Patents Sync in the Admin Panel.
2. Select IPfolio Fields to Include. Use the PortfolioIQ Sync Fields field set (on the Patent object) to select the
IPfolio fields to copy to Innography patent records.
Page 477
| 12 - Integrations
a. After updating the field set, go to the Admin Panel and click the Add PortfolioIQ fields or Delete 
PortfolioIQ fields buttons to update the fields in Innography. (IPfolio compares the fields in the 
field set with those currently configured in Innography and adds or removes fields accordingly.)
More info: PortfolioIQ lets you add IPfolio fields to Innography records. Please note that public
patent records in Innography and private patent records created by IPfolio in Innography include
common bibliographic fields. It is not necessary to add these fields to the PortfolioIQ Sync Fields
field set.
The PortfolioIQ integration keeps records up-to-date automatically. However, it can be helpful to sync individual
patent records manually.
3. To sync individual records, add the PortfolioIQ Sync button to the patent page layout.
4. Add the Link to Innography to the patent layout (this makes it easy to go to Innography records directly
from IPfolio patents).
Setting up PortfolioIQ for Invention Disclosures
You need to enable PortfolioIQ for invention disclosures, and select the IPfolio fields that you want to copy to
Innography invention disclosure records.
Page 478
IPfolio User Guide
1. Select Enable Invention Disclosures Sync in the Admin Panel.
2. Select IPfolio Fields to Include. Use the Invention Description field set (on the Invention Disclosure object)
to select the IPfolio fields to copy to Innography invention disclosure records.
The PortfolioIQ integration keeps records up-to-date automatically. However, it can be helpful to sync individual
patent records manually.
3. To sync individual records, add the PortfolioIQ Sync button to the invention disclosure page layout.
Prosecution Analytics Widget
IPfolio users can view Innography Prosecution Analytics data for the current record without logging in to
Innography with the Innography Prosecution Analytics widget.
Page 479
| 12 - Integrations
Figure 69. Innography Prosecution Analytics Widget
Remember: The current user needs a named seat in Innography to use the Innography Prosecution
Analytics Widget.
How It Works
Before we display Innography Prosecution Analytics for an IPfolio record, we need to find the Innography record,
and to verify we found the right record. We use IP ONE Data to ensure we have the right record.
As IP ONE Data finds and updates data, it creates IP ONE Sync Details records that capture information about 
matches it makes. These records score our confidence in the match.
When you click the Analytics tab:
âª We find the matching Innography record.
âª We check the IP ONE Sync Details confidence score for the match.
âª If the confidence score is âHighâ, we show you the data.
âª If the confidence score is not âHighâ, we do not show the data.
âª If the record has never synced with IP ONE Data, we try to sync in real-time.
âª If the sync is successful, and the confidence score is âHighâ, we show you the data.
Invention Screening
IPfolio users also having access to Innography have the possibility to conduct an integrated Invention Screening for
every new Invention Disclosure, so they can easily filter out inventions that are clearly not novel.
The following invention disclosure fields are used as a joint basis for the semantic publication/prior art search in
Innography:
âª Title
âª Short Description
âª Problem Solved
âª Novel Features
âª Advantages
âª Disadvantages
Page 480
IPfolio User Guide
Note: All publication/prior art searches are conducted in English. If the content of a field is in a different 
language, it will be auto-translated to English. The translation is performed by the Microsoft translation
service. The text is sent to the service anonymously over an encrypted connection with no user-identifying
information. The jurisdictions considered in the search are US, JP, CN, KR, WO, EP and DE.
Conducting an Invention Screening
You can conduct an integrated Invention Screening for every new Invention Disclosure.
1. Open the Invention Disclosure record.
2. Go to the Invention Screening tab. A new search will be conducted upon selecting the tab, and the results 
table will be loaded.
You can now review the results and create Publication records for all the results you consider relevant for the
invention.
Creating Publications/Cited References from Invention Screening Results
You can create linked Publication records from one or more Invention Screening results.
Page 481
| 12 - Integrations
1. Activate the checkboxes of all results you want to create linked Publication records
for.
2. Click Create Cited Prior Art (IDF) above the results table.
IPfolio will create new Publication records for all selected entries for which no record exists yet. It will also
download the related documents as "Main Publication Copies", and will list the records as "Cited References" on the
Relations tab of the Invention Disclosure.
Configuring the Semantic Search
The fields included in the semantic search can be configured by using a specific field set.
The semantic search functionality in the Invention Screening allows users to screen submitted invention disclosures
for existing prior art. The field set configuration enhances the flexibility and adaptability of the screening process by
allowing users to customize which fields are included in the semantic search.
1. Got to Setup> Object Manager> Invention Disclosure > Field Sets> Invention Screening Fields.
Result: This field set will be used to designate which fields should be included in the Innography semantic
search.
2. Include necessary fields in the field set. By default, the following fields are included: Title, Short 
Description, Problem Solved, Novel Features, Advantages, Disadvantages.
3. Once the necessary fields are included, save the field set to apply the configuration.

Third-Party-Integration
IPfolio can easily be linked with other data structures or software (database, spreadsheet, other enterprise software
solutions like Workday, SAP, etc.).
To realize this functionality, IPfolio uses third-party integration tools and suites that serve as a connection between
Salesforce and the desired data structure or software. Additionally, workflows can be configured to determine the
trigger points for the integrations.
Some examples of third-party-integrations include:
âª Boomi
âª Jitterbit
âª Mulesoft
âª Informatica

Chapter 13. Costs
With the IPfolio Cost module you can track and manage IP related costs.
The IPfolio Cost module tracks IP related costs. The Cost module works with:
â¢ Mining Sessions, Invention Disclosures, Patent Families, Patents
â¢ Trademark Search Requests, Trademark Families, Trademarks, Third Party Trademarks
â¢ Design Rights, Design Families
â¢ Conflicts
â¢ Contracts
â¢ Domain Names
â¢ General Matters
You can create cost records a number of ways:
âª Create the cost, then assign it to a record â From the Cost object, click New. Add the name of the related record 
in the appropriate lookup field.
âª Create the cost from a related record â Go to a record with costs. Click Finance, then New in the Costs related 
list.
âª Import costs records.
Cost Records
The Cost object stores all cost records. Each cost record includes:
âª Basic information about the cost, like the amount of the expense.
âª A link to the record associated with the expense.
Cost linked to a conflict
Some costs link to more than one record. For example, if you link a cost to a patent, IPfolio automatically links the
cost to the patent family too.
Page 485
| 13 - Costs
Cost linked to patent and patent family
Costs Related List
The Costs related list shows costs for the current record.
Costs related list on a patent record
Note: Costs added to patents will show in the patent and patent family related lists.
Associate Cost with Vendor or Cost Category
You can associate costs with vendors and categories too.
âª Vendor â Associates the current cost with a party.
âª Cost Category â Associates the current cost with a Cost category.
Costs related this way show in the Costs related list on a given vendor or cost category record.

Total Cost
Some objects include a Total Cost field, a sum of all related costs. Total Cost is especially helpful in reports.
Mining Session, Patent Family, Patent, Trademark Search Request, Trademark Family, Domain Name Family, Patent
Review, and Review objects all have a Total Cost field.
Total Cost on patent family record
Note: When calculating the rollup total cost for a record in orgs using multiple currencies, the calculations 
are based on the parent record currency, even if the one defined on the org level is different. If the currency
exchange rate is changed, the total amount also changes (not instantly, but on the next rollup), i.e. the
historical data are not shown.
Tip: To activate multiple currencies in an org, use the Activate Multiple Currencies setting (Setup â 
Company Information â Activate Multiple Currencies). To add or remove currencies/edit exchange rates,
use the Manage Currencies setting (Setup â Manage Currencies).
Import Costs
IPfolio makes it easy to import cost records. See Import Costs (on page 543) in the Data Management section for 
details.

Cost Forecast
IPfolio provides AI-powered forecasting of prosecution costs based on patterns extracted from your past cost
information.
This cloud service helps you get an understanding of what the companyâs money is or will be spent for and take factbased decisions on the future evolution of your portfolio (filing, maintenance, commercialization, etc.).
Our Cost Forecast module lets you:
âª Efficiently manage and track your IP costs comparing actuals to budgets.
âª Create budget scenarios to make smarter filing and maintenance decisions.
âª Collaborate seamlessly with stakeholders using real-time reports and dashboards integrated to achieve faster
budget approvals.
Important:
Cost Forecast is a paid service. To be able to use it, you need to get a license and have your org properly
configured and connected. For details please contact the IPfolio Premium Services Team.
Cost Tracking
You can get an overview of actual and future costs related to all existing patents and other IP rights handled in the
IPfolioâs Patent record on the IP Right (Patent), Family (Patent Family) and Portfolio (Category) levels.
Cost Tracking: Patents
To see the actual and forecast costs related to a Patent, use the Finance tab on a Patent record.
The figures displayed include:
Cost YTD Sum of actual costs incurred to date in the current fiscal year
Cost Forecast YTG Cost forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year (year to go)
Page 488
IPfolio User Guide

Planning and Managing Your Budget
With our budgeting functionality you can track actuals against forecasts and run âwhat ifâ budget scenarios to
assess the impact of potential decisions, thus reducing the risk of budget under- or over-runs.
AI technology generates accurate budget predictions, automatically analyzing the factors impacting your patent
costs and letting you compare and track your active budget vs actuals vs forecast.
Creating a Scenario
To get an idea how much it might cost you to maintain the existing patents within a category and/or expand (plan
how many new filings you wish to add, which costs this would entail, if itâs in line with the budget, etc.), create a
Scenario.
If you would like to exclude a specific Cost record from the Cost Forecast calculation, you can do so by enabling
the Exclude from Cost Forecasting checkbox field on this Cost record before you create a Scenario and run the
forecast.
Page 490
IPfolio User Guide
1. Open the Scenarios tab on the Category record .
2. Click New.
3. Fill in Scenario Title and Fiscal Year (or Calendar Year depending on the Org settings).
4. Click Save.
5. Fill in the Filing Table: enter how many patent applications of which filing type you would like to file in
which jurisdictions/countries within the budgeting/forecast period .
6. Click Save.
7. Request the calculation to be made by clicking Forecast Now!.
The forecast calculation might take some time. You can track its progress by clicking Show Details under the 
Calculating your forecast... message above the Filing Table.
Once the forecast is ready, if you realize that you are exceeding your budget (or, on the contrary, there is room for
expanding), you can edit the Scenario and run a new calculation.
Page 491
| 13 - Costs
Please bear in mind that you can run another forecast calculation for the same Scenario, only when the current
forecast calculation is complete.
Note: Upon the creation of a new Scenario, Scenario Filing and Future IP Right records are created, based
on the historical data and planned future filings, respectively.
Scenario Filings
Upon the creation of a new Scenario, historical data is being queried for the Category, in which the Scenario is being
created. Based on this queried data, Scenario Filing records are created.
Note:
âª For the Scenario to be as accurate as possible, the dates of the historical data taken into account are the
ones relative to "today"- the current date.
For example:
âª Patents for first filings are taken into consideration, if the filing date is within the last 12 months -
starting from one year ago to today.
âª Start and end dates of the previous fiscal year are not used to filter historical patents. It can happen
that patents filed in the first months of the previous fiscal year are not considered, if the filing date is
more than 12 months ago.
âª Historical data (Patents and Categorizations) is retrieved regardless of the fact, if the current user
created those records â i.e., all historical records are considered, even if the user creating the Scenario
did not create the related Patents.
Page 492
IPfolio User Guide
Future IP Rights
Once the number of future filings for the selected jurisdictions/countries is entered into the Filing Table, and the
Scenario calculation is triggered, Future IP Right records are created.
For each future filing indicated in the Scenario, one Future IP Right record is created.
For example, if 20 first filings in DE are planned, 20 respective Future IP Right records will be created.
If the Scenario, for which Future IP Rights were already created, is edited later on, and the quantity of the future
filings is changed, all the originally created Future IP Right records (e.g., 20 first filings in DE from the example
above) are deleted, and a full subset of new ones is created in accordance with the new Scenario figures.
Editing a Scenario
Before the Scenario is approved, you can edit it.
1. Open the Scenario record.
2. Click Edit.
3. Update whatever you need in the Edit form.
4. Click Save.
More info: 
âª Please note that you can edit a Scenario only before it is approved. Once you approve the forecast,
it will no longer be possible to edit it, and all the other Scenarios for the same planning period will be 
cancelled.
âª Once the Scenario Status=Cancelled, it is not possible to edit it, either.
âª The Scenario whose Status=Expired is not editable, either.
âª Until the Scenario is approved, its Status is Planning.
Page 493
| 13 - Costs
Approving/Activating a Scenario
Once you are happy with the forecast, you can approve and thus activate the Scenario (change its Status to Active).
Please note that you will not be able to edit the Scenario after you approve the forecast.
1. Open the Scenario record.
2. Click Approve.
3. Enter the approved budget amount.
4. Click Approve.
âª The Scenario's Status changes to Active for the planning period (Fiscal or Calendar Year) indicated in it. Once
this period comes to an end, the Scenario Status changes to Expired and canât be edited anymore. The record
owner gets a notification about it by email.
âª 7 days* before a Scenario in Status=Planning reaches its Planning Period Start date, the Scenario creator is 
reminded by email to set at least one of the Scenarios of the Category into Status=Active, i.e. enter and approve
a budget.
*7 days is a default setting. You can edit it here: Setup > Custom Code > Custom Metadata Types > Budgeting
Configuration > Number of days before the period starts.
Note:
You cannot delete a Scenario with the Status= Active. You can cancel it by approving another Scenario for
the same Category/Fiscal Year.
Cloning a Scenario
You can clone existing Scenarios.
Page 494
IPfolio User Guide
1. Open the Scenario record.
2. Click Clone.
3. Click Yes.
The newly created Scenario will have the same (as the "original" Scenario):
âª Category
âª Planning period
âª Filing records
Scenario Title = Copy NN of Scenario Title (where NN = ordinal number of the clone for this Scenario, and 
Scenario Title = name of the original Scenario).
Advanced Reporting
To visualize and analyze actual costs combined with cost forecasts, as well as use filtering options to slice them by
country, cost type, vendor, fiscal year and other IP Right properties, see the Cost Forecast Category Record Details
section on the Details tab of the Category record.

Chapter 14. Reports & Dashboards
Reports and dashboards help you understand your IP portfolio, and provide key insights into your data.
Reports
Use Reports to review and analyze your data. Click Reports on the Navigation Bar to see existing reports and create
new reports.
âª IPfolio comes with a rich set of predefined reports, and a graphical Report Builder that makes it easy to build a
report.
âª You can create single-use, ad-hoc reports, or save reports for future use.
âª Report folders help you organize reports, and are used to control access to reports.
âª When running reports, IPfolio pulls the data in real-time, so reports are always up-to-date.

Reports vs. Views
Table: Key Differences
Reports Views
Data is not editable in Reports Data is editable in Views
Reports can pull data from multiple objects (âPatent with
Categoriesâ)
Views only pull data from the current object (âPatentsâ)
Report data can be exported (to .xls or .csv) View data canât be exported
The number of Reports you can create is virtually unlimited
There are practical limits to the number of List Views 
you can create

by a specific column by selecting the required column.
â¦ Add Filters to restrict the report to specific values.
â¦ Click Add chart to create a chart from the report.
4. Click Save, and then select the required folder to share the report with your team.
See Build a Report in Lightning Experiencefor more details on creating new reports.
Subscribing to a Report
By subscribing to a report you can have the latest updates to a report delivered to your inbox, or receive
notifications when certain conditions are met.
You are limited to a combined total of seven report AND dashboard subscriptions.
1. On the Reports screen, click the more actions arrow on the right of the required report, and then select 
Subscribe. Alternatively, you can open the report, and then click Subscribe.
2. Edit the subscription settings.
a. Select the required frequency.
b. Optional: To include the report results as an attached file, click Attach file, and the select 
Formatted Report (.xlsx format) or Details only (.csv format).
c. Select the required recipients. By default you are added as recipient. You can add other users,
groups, or roles as required.
d. Optional: You can also add conditions to a report subscription. In this case the subscribers will
be notified when all of the conditions are met. Select Add conditions to this report and then 
select the required values.
3. Click Save.
For further information, see these Salesforce resources: Schedule and Subscribe to Reports, and this video tutorial: 
Subscribe to Dashboards and Reports.
Report Folders
You can use report folders to keep your reports organized. You can also use folders to control access to reports.
âª Reports in Unfiled Public Reports are seen by all users.
âª Reports in My Personal Custom Reports are seen by the current user only.
To control access to Reports, see Report and Dashboard Folders.

| 14 - Reports & Dashboards
Relative Date Filter References
When creating Views and Reports, you can use ârelative date filter referencesâ instead of actual dates. Relative date
filters let you filter on date fields using easy-to-understand, speech-inspired syntax.
For example, instead of filtering on âFiling Date greater than Jan 1â, you can filter on âFiling Date equals this yearâ.
See Relative Date Filter Reference for more information.
Exporting Reports Including Images
You can export reports to Microsoft Excel. Some reports, such as Trademark and Trademark Family reports, contain
images which can also be exported to Excel.
When preparing Microsoft Excel reports containing images, it is recommended to use the IMAGE function provided
by Microsoft Excel (click herefor details).
1. Make sure the report to be created contains the standard Preview image formula field.
More info: 
By default, IPfolio creates private image URLs using the Preview image formula field. This means that the 
images in the report will only be visible to people that are currently logged in to IPfolio.
Alternatively, it is also possible to create public URLs instead â which will be accessible for everyone
knowing the exact URL. In this case, the image column to be exported must leverage the Content Download 
URL, e.g. using the following formula:
IF(ISBLANK(Content_Download_URL_c),null,"=IMAGE(\""+Content_Download_URL_c+"\",\"Image\",0)")
2. Export the report in CSV format (comma-delimited). Images are automatically transformed into URLs.
3. Open the CSV file in Microsoft Excel.
4. Go to Data > Get Data (Power Query) > From Text(Legacy).
5. Select the CSV export file and click Get Data.
6. Make sure the Column data format of the image column is set to General and not to Text. Excel will then
automatically apply the IMAGE function to the column.
7. Finish the export.
The images should now be displayed in the correct cells of your Microsoft Excel report, and will be filtered and
sorted with adherent cells. Resizing cells will automatically resize any contained images, too.
Dashboards
Dashboards display your IPfolio data in a graphical layout.
To access dashboards, do one of the following:
âª Click the Home tab.
âª Click the Dashboards link in the Visualize section of the sidebar (on the left of most pages).
Page 498
IPfolio User Guide
Figure 71. Dashboard screen
Key Concepts
âª Dashboards are a collection of âdashboard componentsâ.
âª For every dashboard component, there is an underlying report.
âª Dashboards have a âRunning Userâ that controls which records are included in the underlying data.
âª Dashboards need to be âRefreshedâ (manually or automatically) to show current data.
Additional Salesforce Resources
See Reports & Dashboardsfor more information.
Creating New Dashboards
IPfolio comes with a rich set of predefined dashboards. You can create your own custom dashboards to meet your
business needs.
1. Create an empty dashboard.
2. Create a report.
3. Create a chart from the report.
4. Add the chart to the dashboard.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 as needed.

Adding a Dashboard Filter
Filters are useful to quickly visualize subsets of data in your dashboards. For example, you might want to set a filter
for inventions that belong to different business units.
See Add a Dashboard Filterfor detailed instructions.
Adding a List-based Report to Dashboards
Although Dashboards are used primarily for charts, you can also add dashboard components representing tabular
report data.
Tabular reports in dashboards are limited to 2 columns.
1. In Reports, click New Report, then type âPatentâ to filter the list.
2. Click Patents, then Create.
3. In Filters, click Show Me and select All Patents.
4. In Outline, add the following fields: Patent ID, Firm Attorney, Filing Overdue (Days), File By Date, and First
Draft Received (or the fields of your choosing) into the Preview area.
5. Set a Row Limit to specify the maximum number of records that should be displayed on the Dashboard.
6. Specify the columns to be shown on the Dashboard in Dashboard Settings.
7. In Dashboards, add the reports as a Dashboard Element of type Table.
8. Specify the Drill-Down behavior (we recommend using âSource Reportâ).
Dashboard Data Refresh
Dashboards need to be refreshed to show current data. Dashboards can be refreshed manually or automatically.
The most convenient way to schedule automatic dashboard refreshes is via the IPfolio Admin Panel.
It is also possible to subscribe to dashboards or schedule individual dashboard refreshes in Salesforce.
Note: IPfolioâs pre-defined dashboards are scheduled to refresh every morning.
Configuring Automatic Dashboard Refreshes
Admin users can configure and adapt automatic refreshes for a defined set of IPfolio Dashboards in the Admin 
Panel.

Chapter 15. System Administration
The IPfolio Customer Support team is always there to cooperate with your system administrators to set up,
configure and customize IPfolio according to your business needs.
Administrators are âall-powerfulâ in IPfolio.
âª Administrators can configure and customize IPfolio (including managing Users).
âª Administrators have access to all data in IPfolio.
There are typically two administratorsââ one from your company, and one from IPfolio.
Warning: Administrators have unlimited control of your org, including all users, configuration, and data.
Setup
Most administrative tasks are performed in Setup.
To navigate Setup:
1. Click gear icon
2. Click Setup
3. Enter a keyword in Quick Find
4. Click the desired setting
Note: We abbreviate this as: Setup Quick Find keyword.
Managing Users
Deactivating a User
SSO users and direct-login users sign-in differently, and they are de-activated differently. Either way, itâs best
practice to deactivate users in IPfolio as soon as access is no longer required. (Remove the check from the âActiveâ
field.)
Page 510
IPfolio User Guide
Note: Always work closely with your IT group on security-related issues, including activating and
deactivating users. See User Managementfor more information.
Transferring User Records
After deactivating a user, you should transfer all records owned by the user so reminders and notifications go to an
active user.
The records you need to transfer depend on:
âª The role of the user leaving (paralegal, In-House Counsel).
âª Which user role âownsâ records (this can vary).
âª Which IPfolio features and services you use (DocketEngine).
Common objects include:
âª Invention Disclosures, Patent Families, Trademark Families, and IP Rights, plus possibly for Contracts/Projects
and Products.
âª And possibly Categories and other objects where record-level user rights (Sharing Settings) are set.
Note: Contact IPfolio Customer Supportfor help if needed.
Customer Support
Availability and Hours
Support for all inquiries, including technical, account administration, and billing, is available primarily by email.
We provide live support between 8 am to 8 pm U.S. Central Time, and through our partners around the globe. If you
do not have a personal contact at IPfolio or your local partner, please contact IPfolio Customer Support.
Page 511

The Admin Panel is designed to make setup, administration, and support of your IPfolio Org easier. The Admin Panel:
âª Consolidates admin settings into a centralized âcontrol panelâ.
âª Groups settings logically.
âª Enhances and improves certain settings.
Use the App Launcher to find and open the Admin Panel.
The Admin Panel has five tabs.
âª The Home tab contains âOrg detailsâ like the Org Id and IPfolio version.
âª The Integrations tab contains various subsections for the management of the following topics:
âª IPsync (TDS)
âª IP One
âª PortfolioIQ
âª CompuMark
âª iHub
âª ELM (Enterprise Legal Management)
âª Payment Service

IPfolio User Guide
âª Homepage lets the customers using CRM Analytics modify World map and Portfolio Explorer links, so that
they could be directly forwarded to the new dashboards.
âª The Email Settings tab displays all the common system-wide Email Settings (on page 196).
âª EP Portal Credentials lets you edit EP Portal Credentials on various user levels.
âª Under the Miscellaneous tab you can enable the special logic for calculating the status of SPC/PTE records.
âª Triggers Behavior lets you change the behavior (Dynamic, Legacy) of triggers.
âª The Smart Docketing tab enables the Incoming Correspondence (on page 414) functionality.
Note: The Admin Panel manages passwords and other sensitive data securely.
Important Caveats
âª The Admin Panel is intended primarily for IPfolio Support.
âª While your âadminâ users can change Admin Panel settings, we recommend they donât.
âª Misconfiguration can disrupt your service or lead to data loss.
âª Contact IPfolio Support for help.
Delegation
When an IP team member is out, IPfolioâs new Delegation module makes it easy to assign their cases to a co-worker
so nothing gets missed.
Overview
Transferring a record to another user is a great way to ensure that person can take over for you in your absence. But
transferring records manually is impractical for anything more than a few records.
The Delegation module manages the process for you. You tell the system:
âª Which records you want to transfer (Patents only, patents and trademarks, etc.)
âª Who to transfer the records to.
âª When to transfer the records (and when to transfer them back.)
IPfolio does the rest.
Page 513
| 15 - System Administration
Setup
âª Go to the Delegation object and create a new âDelegation recordâ. (This can be done by the person who will be
out or someone on their behalf.)
âª Enter the Assign From and Assign To users.
âª Enter the Start Date and End Date.
âª Select the record types to re-assign. (For example, âInvention Disclosuresâ, âPatent Familiesâ and âPatentsâ.)
âª IPfolio transfers the records to the Assigned To user on the Start Date and transfers the records back on the
End Date.
âª âScheduled jobsâ run overnight. Records can be transferred immediately using the Next button.
Note: Since this feature may change many records, it runs in âbatchâ (background) mode. Changes to
records and tasks can take up to 15 minutes to appear.
How It Works
In IPfolio:
âª All records have an Owner field.
âª Many records (patents, trademarks, and others) also have an In-House Counsel field.
The delegation feature looks at the records you specify, and:
âª Finds records where Owner or In-House Counsel matches the Assign From user.
âª Changes the Owner or In-House Counsel to the Assign To user.
âª Assigns open related tasks to the new user too.
Page 514
IPfolio User Guide
Considerations
âª The delegation feature is helpful for larger teams whose members cover for others they are out.
âª You determine who can use it and how itâs used. (For example, you can manage delegations for others, or let
users create delegations themselves.)
Note: IPfolio email normally sent to a user, is sent to the delegated user, until the delegation is reverted.
Hierarchical Sharing
By default, the only portal users who can see an invention disclosure are the inventors on the disclosure. Our
âHierarchical Sharingâ feature automatically shares disclosures with additional portal users. Specifically,
Hierarchical Sharing shares disclosures with inventors and their supervisors and reports.
Hierarchical Sharing is available for invention disclosures and patents.
How It Works
Share Records
There are many ways to share records in IPfolio. For example, records can be shared:
âª Using the Share button to share records manually.
âª Using âRolesâ to share records with pre-defined groups of users.
Regardless of how a record is shared, the result is the same: IPfolio creates a hidden share record that tracks who the
record is shared with and how it was shared.
Hierarchical Sharing uses this feature to share disclosures. For a given disclosure, IPfolio code:
âª Finds all inventors, and their supervisors, and their reports.
âª Creates hidden shares to give them access.
Note: Hierarchical Sharing lets users with restricted profiles see records they wouldnât be able to see
otherwise. Hierarchical Sharing doesnât affect Systems Administrators, IP Superusers, or others who
already have access to disclosures and patents.
Find Supervisors and Reports
Supervisors are stored on Contacts in the Reports To field.
To find all (direct and indirect) supervisors and reports:
âª We find the inventorâs contact record.
âª We find the inventorâs direct and indirect supervisors, traversing âupâ the hierarchy.
Page 515
| 15 - System Administration
âª We find the inventorâs direct and indirect reports, traversing âdownâ the hierarchy.
âª Once all supervisors and reports are found, we share the record with them.
Recursive Search
Traversing Up
1. Add the current contact.
2. Find the current contactâs Reports To contact.
Repeat 1 and 2 until Reports To is blank OR Reports To is the current contact.
Traversing Down
1. Add the current contact(s).
2. Find all contacts whose Reports To includes the current contact(s).
Repeat 1 and 2 until you reach a contact who is no longer found in the Reports To of other contacts.
Updating Shares
We also monitor for changes that affect sharing. For example, we update sharing when:
âª Inventors change.
âª Reports To changes.
âª New users are added.
âª Delegees are added, removed, and changed.
Implementation Details
Custom Settings
Select the Enable Hierarchical Sharing Model (on page 559) custom setting to enable this feature.
Contacts
For this feature to work, the HR feed used to populate Contacts must include accurate supervisor information.
Create New Sharing Record
Create an IDF/Patent Sharing Record
âª Sharing records are created for Users, not Contacts. (We query Contacts to find Users.)
âª Our query matches using either Contact.Unique_Employee_ID to User.EmployeeNumber, or Contact.Email to 
User.Email, depending on the matching type in custom settings.
Page 516
IPfolio User Guide
Sharing Reason
You need to provide a âsharing reasonâ when creating a share record. Weâve created a new apex sharing reason
âHierarchy Sharingâ on invention disclosures and patents.
âDelegeeâ
Senior executives and others may ask an assistant to run reports on their behalf. Weâve included the ability
to designate a âdelegeeâ that has the same hierarchical sharing access as the delegating employee. Use the
Contact.Delegee lookup to use this feature.
Record Names
Good record names make IPfolio records easy to work with. However, people have different ideas about what a
âgoodâ record name is. Some people prefer short record names that are easy to type and use less space in views and 
reports, while others prefer longer, more descriptive record names.
Regardless of your preference, good record names have certain characteristics.
âª Good record names are unique. The ability to uniquely identify records is a primary purpose of a record name.
âª Good record names donât change over time. When a record name changes it creates extra work and increases
the likelihood of errors. It is best to exclude anything that could change in the record name, including any
references to your company or the current law firm.
Default Record Names
There are hundreds of objects IPfolio â patents, trademarks, conflicts, inventors, data auditsââ and many more.
Each has a Name field.
When you create a record in any of these objects, IPfolio automatically populates the record name using the default
naming convention for that object. For example, the first record created for the following objects will be called:
Object Default Name
Patents P00001-US
Trademarks TM-00001-US
Design Rights D-00001-US
Industrial Designs ID-000001
Multiple Design Applications MDA-D-00001-US
Conflicts CFL-00001
Inventors I-00001
Data Audits PTO-00001
Some customers use all IPfolio default names âas isâ. Other customers modify the default for one or more key
objects, like patents.
Options for changing the default names are discussed in the following sections.
Page 517
| 15 - System Administration
Record Id vs. Record Name
All records have two fields that uniquely identify them:
âª The Id field contains a unique 18 character string used by IPfolio to identify records.
âª The Name is a âfriendlierâ unique name that makes it easier for people to identify records.
Note: We relabel the âNameâ field on most objects to â<Object> IDâ. For example, the Name field on patents
is called âPatent IDâ.
Other Considerations
List Views
You donât need to rely solely on the record name to find records. List Views let you filter, group, sort, and otherwise
organize records by Status, Outside Counsel, Filing Date, and other key fields.
A comprehensive set of List Views can reduce your reliance on record names.
Record Sequence Form Component
Standardize the process of record creation and sequencing across modules and records with our Record Sequence 
Form custom Lightning component.
Designed to eventually replace the standard New action, it was implemented for the Design Module with the 
Summer '25 release and made available for implementation for any IPfolio record.
To use the component, you need to
âª Override the standard New action (on page 519) for the object in question.
âª Have the Display on Record Sequence Form field set added to the required object. This field set includes the 
fields to be shown in the new component - on the form displayed when creating new records.
You can manually add the field set to any object you would like to use the component for.
Page 518
IPfolio User Guide
âª Have an associated Object Setting record created for the object in question to be able to customize the
sequencing format. If the object does not have a related Object Setting record, the suggested ID will be created
using the first three letters of the object name, e.g., IND-00001 for Industrial Designs. If the object has an 
associated Object Setting record with a defined sequencing format, the suggested ID will use it instead.
Overriding the Standard New Action with the Record Sequence Form Component
To use the Record Sequence Form component, you need to override the standard New action for the object you
would like to create records for.
1. Open the configuration page of the necessary object - e.g., Patent (Setup> Object Manager> Patent).
2. Click Buttons, Links, and Actions in the menu on the left.
3. Find the New button, click the down arrow on the right and select Edit.
4. Select the Lightning component option for Lightning Experience Override and Mobile Override and 
choose IPfolio:SequenceRecordFormWrapper from the dropdowns on the right for both.
5. Click Save.
Family Names
In IPfolio, family records are used to group related records.
For example, Patent Family, Trademark Family and Design Family records group Patents, Trademarks and Design
Rights respectively.
Patent Family, Trademark Family and Design Family records also play a role in how Patent, Trademark and Design
Right records are named. Specifically, related Patents, Trademarks and Design Rights inherit the âbase numberâ of
the related family record.
For example, a Patent created from Patent Family âP00010â will have the base number â00010â in its name.
Page 519
| 15 - System Administration
Patent Family
P00010
Patent
P00010-US
Note: Patents, Trademarks and Design Rights get their âbase numberâ from the related family record.
âKeep Family IDs in Syncâ Custom Setting
While itâs good to know that patents (and trademarks) get their base number from the related family record, it begs
the question â¦how do family records get their base number?
When you create a first filed patent from an invention disclosure, IPfolio creates a patent family record in the
background. When creating the family record, IPfolio checks the Keep Family IDs in sync with IDF/TSR ID custom 
setting to determine the correct base number to use.
âª If Keep Family IDs in sync with IDF/TSR ID is selected, the patent family is created with the same base number 
as the IDF.
âª If deselected, the patent family is created with a base number one greater than the base number of the last 
patent family created (using current Values in Object Settings.)
For example, consider a company with 10 invention disclosures (IDF-00001 through IDF-00010) that has not yet
filed a patent. After reviewing the disclosures they decide to file IDF-00010. When they click Approved for Filing on 
IDF-00010, IPfolio checks the Keep Family IDs in sync with IDF/TSR ID custom setting:
âª If selected, the patent family is called âP00010â (the patent family base number matches the IDF base number).
âª If deselected, the patent family is called âP00001â, the first available base number for new patent family records.
After creating the patent family record, IPfolio creates the patent with the same base number of the family.
Note: The process works the same for trademarks.
IDF/TSR Names
The Invention Disclosure Name (âInvention Disclosure IDâ) and Trademark Search Request (âTrademark Search
Request IDâ) Name fields are âAuto Numberâ fields. Auto number fields are helpfulââ they ensure record numbers
are incremented properly and that there are no duplicate Names. However, auto number fields come with some
limitations too:
âª Custom formats are limited. Invention Disclosures will always take the form âIDF-00001â.
âª If you delete an auto number is gone forever. If you delete âIDF-00001â, there is no way to recreate âIDF-00001â.
Customizing Family IDs
Custom placeholders can be used to ensure unique and synchronized IDs for Patent and Trademark Families.
Depending on your custom placeholder settings, whenever a new Patent/Trademark Family is created from an
Invention Disclosure/Trademark Search Request, the Family ID changes accordingly. You can choose between two
options:
Page 520
IPfolio User Guide
âª The custom placeholder % adds a 1-digit numerical suffix when a number-matching Family already exists. For
example P12345, P12345.1, P12345.2 etc.
âª The custom placeholder && always adds a suffix, starting with 00. For example: P12345.00, P12345.01, P12345.02 
etc.
1. Optional: Enable the custom setting Keep Family IDs in sync with IDF/TSR ID.
2. Go to Object Setting> Invention.
3. Click format.
4. Enter the custom placeholder setting of your choice:
â¦ % Format: P{00000}.% or P{00000}-%
â¦ && Format: P{00000}.&& or P{00000}-&&
5. Click Save.
Patent Names
Patent names can communicate a lot of informationââ e.g., about the related invention disclosure, the patent family,
the jurisdiction, and even the patentâs relationship to other patents in the family.
Choosing the right naming convention is a balancing act. The goal is to provide enough information to adequately
describe these complex records, without including information that is redundant or likely to change.
IPfolioâs default patent naming convention works well for many customers, and we encourage you to consider using
it.
Patent Name Components
Patent names consist of a prefix, family/base number, country, suffix, and iterator.
Table: Patent Name Components
âP00001-US-CON2â
âPâ = Prefix
â00001â = Base Number âUSâ = Country âCONâ = Suffix
â2â = Iterator
Prefix and Base Number
The prefix and base number of a patent come from the patent family record. See Family Names (on page 519) for 
details.
Therefore, to change the prefix on patents you actually change the prefix on patent family records. You do this in the
Object Settings for the Invention object.
Note: In Object Settings, the Patent Family is called âInventionâ.
Page 521

Object Settings Tab
Set âFormatâ on the Invention object.
Invention Object Setting
Suffix
IPfolio uses special Patent Suffix Configuration âcustom metadataâ to determine which suffix to use. During patent
creation, we check Patent Suffix Configuration to find the correct suffix for the record based on the Relationship to 
Parent value.
Table: Default Patent Suffix Values

Use the Custom Suffix field to override a default patent suffix value.
For example, you can use Custom Suffix to:
âª Add âPRVâ to provisionals (by entering âPRVâ in Custom Suffix for that record type.)
âª Add no suffix (by entering â[NONE]â in the Custom Suffix field for one or more record types.)

Note: Selecting Remove Suffix when creating Child Record instructs IPfolio to remove the suffix when
creating a child record.
Patent/Trademark Suffix Separators
IPfolio lets you customize the separators that appear before and after the Country Code in the record name using
the following custom settings:
âª Patent/TM Suffix Separator for Country (on page 559)
âª Patent/TM Suffix Separator for Sequence (on page 559)

Design Right Names
Design Right names can communicate a lot of information â e.g., about the related Design Right family, the
jurisdiction, and even the Design Right's relationship to other Design Rights in the family.
Choosing the right naming convention is a balancing act. The goal is to provide enough information to adequately
describe these complex records, without including information that is redundant or likely to change.
Page 523
| 15 - System Administration
IPfolioâs default Design Right naming convention works well for many customers, and we encourage you to consider
using it.
Design Right Name Components
Design Right names consist of a prefix, family/base number, country, suffix, and iterator.
Table: Design Right Name Components
âD-00030-US-DIV4â
âDâ = Prefix
â00030â = Base Number âUSâ = Country âDIVâ = Suffix
â4â = Iterator
Note: When creating a child Design Right where Relationship to Parent=Divisional, the child Design Right 
gets the parent ID, substituting the parent Country Code with the child's one .
Prefix and Base Number
The prefix and base number of a Design Right come from the Design Right Family record. Please see Family Names 
(on page 519) for details.
Therefore, to change the prefix on Design Rights you actually need to change the prefix on Design Family records.
You do this in the Object Settings for the Design Family object.
1. Go App Launcher > Object 
Settings.
2. Open the Design_Family record.
3. Set Format for the Design Family object.
Suffix
IPfolio uses special Design Right Suffix Configuration âcustom metadataâ to determine which suffix to use (Setup 
> Custom Metadata Types > Design Right Suffix Configuration). During Design Right creation, the system checks 
Design Right Suffix Configuration to find the correct suffix for the record based on the Relationship to Parent
value - e.g., âHAGâ for International Designs or âDIVâ for Divisionals.
Page 524

Use the Custom Suffix field to override a default Design Right suffix value (Setup> Custom Metadata Types > 
Design Right Suffix Configuration > Manage Design Right Suffix Configurations > pick the configuration you
would like to edit > Custom Suffix).
Record Matching
Configure the system to match âpersonal informationâ records by Email or Employee ID.
Overview
IPfolio has multiple âpersonal informationâ objects.
âª Contacts are company employees.
âª Parties are people related to IP records.
âª Inventors are people associated with an invention disclosure or patent.
âª Users are people who access the system.
An individual can have multiple âpersonal informationâ records. For example:
âª IDF inventors have a contact record.
âª Patent inventors have a party record.
âª Portal users have a user account and a contact record.
If a person is all of these things, they have all of these records (and inventor records too.)
Matching Personal Information Objects
To function properly, the system needs a way to match a userâs various personal information records. We match
records in two objects by finding a common value in a common field.
For example, User accounts and Party records both have an email field. Given a common email address, we can find
the matching User and Party records.
By default, we match personal information records by email address. Alternatively, you can configure the system to
match personal information records by Employee ID.
To match using Employee ID, activate the Use EmployeeID for matching setting: Admin Panel > Portal Settings > 
Use EmployeeID for matching.
In case Use EmployeeID for matching is enabled, and the user to be matched has no Employee ID, the system
automatically falls back to matching by the user email address. The same logic applies to Contact-Party linking.
Page 525
| 15 - System Administration
When creating a User, the system creates the underlying Party and Contact records, as well as establishes the UserContact, and Contact-Party links, as follows:
For Lightning Portal users:
âª A User is created with a license other than Customer Portal Manager.
âª A Contact is created and the Portal ContactId custom field on the User record is populated with the Contact Id.
âª A Party is created and the Contact custom lookup field is populated with the Contact Id of the above-mentioned
Contact.
For other Portal users (Basic, Stepwise, VF-Based, SLDS):
âª A User is created with the Customer Portal Manager license.
âª A Contact is created and the Contact standard field on the User record is populated with the Contact Id.
âª A Party is created and the Contact custom lookup field on the Party record is populated with the Contact Id of
the above-mentioned Contact.
Relationships between a User and a Contact, and a Party and a Contact, are always created/updated when a User is
created/updated both via Lightning/SLDS Portals and on individual records in the system.
Disabling Contact Record Synchronization
You can disable automatic updates for Contact personal information records when matching user data based on 
Unique Employee ID or Email. To do so, activate the Disable Contact Sync on User Match setting: Admin Panel > 
General Settings > Miscellaneous> Disable Contact Sync on User Match.
Permission Sets
A permission set is a collection of settings and permissions that give users access to features. Permission sets extend
usersâ functional access without changing their profiles.
You need to have admin rights to add users to the permission set.
Permission sets:
âª Ensure one or more users have the correct permissions.
âª Grant access to features.
1. From Setup, enter âPermission Setsâ in the Quick Find box, then select Permission Sets.
2. Select the permission set that you want to assign to users.
3. Click Manage Assignments and then Add Assignment.
4. Select the checkboxes next to the names of the users you want assigned to the permission set and click
Next.
5. Select an expiration option for the assigned users and click Assign.
Duplicate Rules
A duplicate rule defines what happens when a user views a record with duplicates or starts creating a duplicate 
record.
IPfolio has various duplicate rules in place for different settings, ensuring data integrity and preventing duplicate
entries. Further information on duplicate rules can be found here: Salesforce Help.

Security
Security is a primary concern in our business. IPfolio continually strives to increase our security standards based on
the latest research and information on security threats. Our best in class security includes verified internal controls,
and the world-class security provided by the Salesforce platform.
IPfolio Certifications
IPfolio is SSAE 18 SOC 2 Type I and II certified. This independently audited certification confirms that IPfolio has the
internal controls required to deliver high-quality, secure IP management services.
Customer Data
All customer data in IPfolio is hosted exclusively on the world-class infrastructure of Salesforce.com. Below, is an
overview of how your data is hosted and secured.
Backup & Recovery
All customer data is stored in secure data centers and is replicated over secure links to a disaster recovery data
center. This design provides the ability to rapidly restore the Salesforce service in the case of a catastrophic loss. In
addition to these disaster-recovery capabilities, customer data is also backed up to tape in a separate data center.
Tapes are not transported offsite from this data center, reducing the risk of loss. Load-balanced networks, pools of
application servers, and clustered databases are features of the highly scalable and redundant infrastructure design.
Physical Security
Salesforce security standards are on par with the best civilian data centers in the world, including the worldâs most 
security-conscious financial institutions. Authorized personnel must pass through five levels of biometric scanning
to reach the Salesforce system cages. All buildings are completely anonymous, with bullet-resistant exterior walls
Page 527
| 15 - System Administration
and embassy-grade concrete posts and planters around the perimeter. All exterior entrances feature silent alarm
systems that notify law enforcement in the event of suspicion or intrusion.
Network Security
At the network level, perimeter firewalls and edge routers block unused protocols, and internal firewalls segregate
traffic between the application and database tiers. Intrusion detection sensors throughout the internal network
report events to a security event management system for logging, alerts, and reports. A third-party service provider
continuously scans the network externally and alerts changes in baseline configuration.
Certifications
The Salesforce Compliance site lists all the relevant certifications for their hosting infrastructure, such as ISO
27001, SSAE16/ISAE 3402 SOC-1, SOC 2, SOC 3 (SysTrust), and TÃV.
Further Information
We recognize that you will have additional questions about security, beyond the basics covered here. Please
visit Salesforce Trust for more information about the policies, practices and technologies in place to protect our
customer data as a starting point, and ask us about any further detail that you do not find there.
Additional Backup Options
In the highly unlikely event of a disastrous data loss, Salesforce will be responsible for restoring the system.
You may also want to take precautions for the event that data is overwritten or deleted by user error. There are
several tools for tracing unintended data manipulation back in history, such as running History reports or going back
to a locally stored data export. However, there is no such thing as a âone-clickâ restore of the data back to a certain
point in history or the like. You will manually have to import or update records from those sources.
Please note that commercial backup tools for Salesforce are also available from third party vendors like Backupify 
and Reflection.

Key Concepts
Objects
IPfolio data is stored in objects. Objects are similar to spreadsheets:
âª Both hold data.
âª Both include records (a spreadsheet row is like a record).
âª Both include fields (a spreadsheet column is like a field).
But IPfolio objects do much more. Objects contain layout information, custom business logic, and critically, they are
related to other objects.
A basic understanding of objects can make using IPfolio easier.
The following are informal object âtypesâ.
Related information
Object Library (on page 926)
Primary Object
Patents, Trademarks, and Contacts are examples of âprimaryâ objects. Conceptually, primary objects are easy to
understand â they hold the types of records youâd expect and have the type of fields youâd expect. For example, the
patent object holds patent records, and has fields youâd expect, like Filing Date and Application Number.
Grouping Object
A âgroupingâ object is used to group records.
The Patent Family object is an example of a grouping object. Adding the same patent family record name (in the
Patent Family field) on multiple patents groups them together, or âadds them to the familyâ.
This is known as a one-to-many relationshipââ patent family records are related to one or more patent records.
Page 532
IPfolio User Guide
Reference Object
Some objects play a supporting role, ensuring key data is consistent throughout IPfolio. The Country object is a good
example.
Patents, trademarks, and other objects have a Country field to indicate the jurisdiction of the record. Rather than 
adding the country value manually, we use a lookup to the Country object. Lookups to related reference objects
ensure the data is accurate and consistent throughout the system.
Join Object
Join objects are used for âmany-to-manyâ relationships.
Inventors are the textbook example of a many-to-many relationship. A patent can have many inventors, and a
person can be an inventor on many patents.
To model this relationship, we create an âInventorâ join object between them. Each record in the object lists a
specific person and a specific patent, in other words, an inventor.
Relationships
Relating objects provides important benefits. Importantly, it makes it possible for the two objects to share data.
Shared data is stored in fewer places, making it more reliable and easier to maintain.
For example, most sales organizations use a CRM to track opportunities. When tracking multiple people from the
same company, each person gets a record, but they share a common address record. When you change the address,
you update the address for all.
In IPfolio, many objects are related. The following are the types of object relationships.
One-to-many
With a one-to-many relationship, a record of one type can be related to many records of another type.
The Patent/Patent Family relationship is a one-to-many relationship. A patent can be related to one (and only one)
patent family. A patent family can be related to many patents.
Creating a one-to-many relationship is as simple as adding a Lookup field to an object. After doing so:
âª Objects on the âoneâ side of the relationship have a Related List showing all related (âmanyâ) records.
âª Objects on the âmanyâ side show the Lookup field. Entering a value makes the current record a âchildâ of the
named record.
Note: We sometimes call these âparent-childâ relationships, and refer to âparentâ and âchildâ records.
Lookup vs. Master-detail
There are two ways to create a one-to-many relationshipââ using a Lookup or a Master-detail relationship.
Lookup and Master-detail detail relationships are quite similar:
âª Both create a one-to-many relationship.
âª Both result in a âlookupâ field on one object and a Related List on the other.
Page 533
| 15 - System Administration
In fact, from the userâs perspective, itâs hard to tell the difference. The primary difference is technical, with Masterdetail relationships creating a tighter bond between the two records. For example, in a Master-detail relationship,
the âchildâ record owner is always the same as the âparentâ record. Furthermore, deleting the parent deletes the
child records too.
Many-to-many
With a many-to-many relationship, one record of âType Aâ can be related to many records of âType Bâ, and one
record of âType Bâ can be related to many records of âType Aâ.
The textbook example for patents is inventors. One patent can have many inventors, and one inventor can be on
many patents.
Since most relational databases donât support many-to-many relationships directly, we create a join object (on page
532) that sits between the two objects.
Note: We use a Lookup or Master-detail relationship to connect the join object to the other objects.
Data
Where Data Is Stored
Thinking in terms of objects and relationships helps understand where data belongs.
For example, when filing a patent application, clearly the Filing Date and Application Number belong on the patent 
record. While you may refer to these values elsewhere, and they may be used in other business logic, each patent
has one and only one Application Number, and it should be tracked in a field on the patent record.
A grouping object is the best place to track data about the group of records, rather than individual records. For
example, a patent family can be used to count the number of family members, to list inventors from all patents (a
"roll-up"), or to hold other information about the family as a whole.
Note: The patent family (and other grouping objects) are especially helpful for reports.
Reference objects are normally used just for their intended purpose (for example to store individual countries on
the Country object.) But they can be used to store other information too. For example, in addition to storing the
country name, some customers may choose to store other information about the jurisdiction which may be helpful
for prosecution.
Finally, join objects can capture additional information as needed too. For example, inventor records capture the
specific patent and specific person that, when taken together, make them an inventor on the record. But customers
with awards programs may choose to use the inventor join record to store awards information too.
While the details may vary from customer-to-customer, understanding the different types of objects and how they
are related provides helpful insight into where and how your data is stored.
Related Data
As stated earlier, relationships (on page 533) are a good thing. Relating two or more objects makes it possible to
share data between records, making data more reliable and easier to maintain.
Page 534
IPfolio User Guide
Related Lists
Related Lists are likely the most common way data is shared. When you create a Lookup field on an object, IPfolio
automatically creates a Related List on the related object.
For example, the Patent object includes a Patent Family Lookup field. When we created the Patent Family field on 
the patent, IPfolio automatically created a âPatentsâ Related List on the Patent Family object. This means when you
look at a patent family record, you see a list of all related patents.
While details may vary, the key takeaway is this: creating a Lookup field on an object automatically creates a Related
List on the other object.
Formula Fields
When objects are related, you can use formula fields that show values from related records. Formula fields arenât
limited to numbers. In this context, âformulaâ means showing a value from a related record on the current record.
For example, the Invention Disclosure and Patent objects are related. A formula field is one way we can show data
from one on the other. For example, IDF - Title on patents is a formula field that shows the title of the IDF on the 
related patent.
Some limits apply. For example, formula fields donât work with certain types of fields, like Long Text Fields, and there
are limits to the number of formula fields you can have on a given object.
Parent-Child Relationship
As mentioned, establishing a relationship is the first step in sharing data between records. When objects have a
one-to-many relationship (also known as a âparent-childâ relationship), what you can share, and how you share it,
depends on perspective.
Pulling a value from parent to child is straightforward. By definition, a child record has a field indicating its parent.
Creating a formula field that says, âFind my parent and give me the value from a specific fieldâ works for all children.
On the other hand, when starting on the parent, pulling data from children is inherently ambiguous, since the first 
question is always, âWhich child?â We use a âsummary" or âroll-upâ field to get information from one or more child
records on a parent record. The these fields are helpful if you want to count, average or otherwise summarize values
from all child records.
Copy Data on Record Creation
In IPfolio, itâs common to create a record of one type, from a record of another type.
For example:
Page 535
| 15 - System Administration
âª Creating a patent from an invention disclosure.
âª Creating a patent or trademark from the related family record.
âª A less obvious example is creating âpatent inventorâ records (Inventor object) from âIDF inventorâ records
(Inventor IDF object) in the background when creating a patent from an invention disclosure.
When creating an object of one type from an object of another type, and the two objects have fields in common,
IPfolio copies field values during record creation. Examples include managed fields like Title and Firm Attorney, and 
custom fields like âBusiness Groupâ (or other custom fields).
We have used a few different approaches to copy values for common fields.
Cloning Records
Salesforce includes a Clone button to clone/copy existing records. While this seems like a good way to speed up
data entry, itâs not. Cloning bypasses important business logic and creates other problems. We strongly discourage
customers from cloning records.
Field Sets
We sometimes use field sets (notably to select the fields to copy in the IDF > Patent process).
Field sets generally work well. Their primary advantage is flexibility, since you can choose the fields you want to
include (all fields on all objects are available for selection).
Code
We also use âcode and conventionâ. That is, when you follow certain naming conventions, IPfolioâs code copies the
values automatically.
How It Works
During record creation, we check the field names on both objects. When we find fields with the same name, we 
automatically copy the field value to the new record.
For example, when you create a trademark from a trademark family (Trademark Family â Trademark):
âª Given both objects have a custom field Business Group (and the API names match) â¦ 
âª Then IPfolio copies the value from Business Group (on the Trademark Family) to Business Group (on the
Trademark).
The following are objects with this functionality.
Object â Object Matching
Patent Family â Patent API Name
Trademark Family â Trademark API Name
Trademark Search Request â Trademark
API Name
IDF â Patent Label
IDF â Patent Family Label
Page 536
IPfolio User Guide
Object â Object Matching
Mining Session â IDF API Name
IDF Inventor â Patent Inventor API Name
(various objects) â Task API Name
Recordal Project â Recordal Portfolio API Name
Additional Details
Account for Namespaces
We strip the namespace from the API field name before matching fields. If the names match after removing
IPfolio__, we consider it a match. For example, IPfolio__Important_Field__c and Important_Field__c will match.
Accountfor Variations in Common Field Names
Some managed fields have different API names on different objects. These copy even though the names donât match.
We have created hard-coded mappings to account for minor differences between some fields. (For example, the API
name of Law Firm is IPfolio__Representative__c on some objects, and IPfolio__Law_Firm__c on others.)
Prevent Duplicates
We still use field sets in some areas. Our code prevents duplicates these may create.
Exclude Fields
We exclude some fields (we donât copy values even though the field names match).
âª For instance, some fields (like the Record ID) are unique and shouldnât be copied.
âª Another example is Law Firm Reference â this field was excluded from the Copy Same Name Fields
functionality, since its copying to child records might add unintentional or duplicate Law Firm References into
the system and/or result in IPsync matching child records based on the Law Firm Reference and updating all
child records with invalid data.
âª Also, when copying inventor information from parent to child patents, only IPfolio packaged fields are copied.
Other customer, local or standard, fields are ignored, so that the parent patent information does not interfere
with the child patent data (e.g., the Patent Awards data).
âª Other examples include formula fields and rollup fields (since each record may have unique/different values).
âª You can also use the âSkip copy same name fieldsâ field set to define the fields to be skipped during the automatic
copying of field values from one object to another. It is available on such objects as Patent Family (to prevent
copying fields to Patent); Trademark Search Request and Trademark Family (to prevent copying fields to
Trademarks).
Other Potential Issues
You may do everything right and still run into minor issues. For example, you may have fields with matching names
with different picklist values.

Data Import Tools
You can use IPfolioâs built-in tools, or third-party tools, to important and export data. At IPfolio, we use all of the
following tools. While large or complex imports may require a certain tool, we suggest using the tool thatâs easiest for 
you.
Warning: Please see âBefore You Startâ (on page 531).
Data Import Wizard
Setup Quick Find Import Data Import Wizard

Importing Data
Data imports are used to add or edit data in bulk.
âª Data imports are generally performed by administrators.
âª Some imports are easier than others. Imports that include lookup fields (like Owner) or other related data can 
be more involved.
âª There are a number of data import tools (on page 538) available.
Warning: Please see âBefore You Startâ (on page 531).
Key Considerations
Identify the Object
Identify the object you want to import data into.
âª âStandardâ objects come with Salesforce and are not added by IPfolio.
âª âCustomâ objects are added by IPfolio.
Most objects of interest â Patents and Trademarks for exampleââ are custom objects. One notable exception is the
Contacts object, which is a standard object.
Insert, Update, or Upsert
Determine whether you need to:
âª Add new records (âInsertâ).
âª Update existing records (âUpdateâ).
âª Add new records and update existing records (âUpsertâ).
Record ID
When updating records (âUpdateâ or âUpsertâ) you need to provide a unique record ID. This makes sense. After all, if
you want to update a record, IPfolio needs to know exactly which record you want to update.
IPfolio has two IDs you can use:
âª A âfriendly IDâ that appears on most records. (For example, a patent record with a âPatent IDâ of P-001.)
âª A âSalesforce IDâ, a unique 15-character or 18-character ID that all IPfolio records have.
Page 539
| 15 - System Administration
Note: VLOOKUPS in Excel are case-insensitive. Using the 15 character case-sensitive Salesforce ID
can cause problems. Salesforce recommends using 18 character case-insensitve Salesforce ID whenever
possible.
The Salesforce ID is unambiguous and always works. However, it is:
âª Not normally shown on records.
âª âLess friendlyâ. (For example, âa0L36000004yRGfâ.)
âª Generally a bit harder to work with.
Two of the import tools mentioned below let you use the âfriendly IDâ, but one doesnât. Using the âfriendly IDâ can
make imports a bit easier (and may affect which tool you choose to use).
CSV Files
Excel often strips leading zeros from values. For example, opening/editing/saving a .csv file, a value of â0015â 
might get truncated to â15â. Avoid using leading zeros when possible and be mindful of this issue when working with
Excel.
Sample Imports
Import Contacts
Updating Contacts is a common data import task.
The Contacts object holds a list of your companyâs employees. The list is used on the portal to help inventors
accurately name co-inventors.
In this example, our goal is to demonstrate the steps you need to take to update your contacts monthly.
Warning: Please see âBefore You Startâ (on page 531).
Data Requirements
âª Your HR group provides you with a list of current employees.
âª Required fields include: First Name, Last Name, Email, and Unique Employee ID
âª Additional fields can be imported too. Employee Status, Work Country, and Business Unit are popular optional/
supplemental fields.
Contacts Object
âª Contacts is a standard object (on page 539).
âª Contacts comes with First Name, Last Name, Email, and Unique Employee ID fields.
âª It may be necessary to create Contact fields to hold supplemental data.
Page 540
IPfolio User Guide
Import Specifications
âª For ongoing Contact imports, we add new records and update existing records (an âUpsertâ).
âª For technical reasons, we donât delete existing contacts. To track whether employees are active, consider
including Employee Status in the import data.
âª The Unique Employee ID is crucial to this process. We use the Unique Employee ID to match records in IPfolio 
with the updated records provided by your HR group. (See Record ID (on page 539) for more information.)
Choose a Tool
Our user chooses the Data Import Wizard (on page 538) because:
âª She has fewer than 50,000 records to import.
âª She doesnât want to install other apps or login to another website.
âª And importantly, this is the tool she is most comfortable using.

Import Costs
The IPfolio Cost module tracks IP related costs. The Cost module works with:
â¢ Mining Sessions, Invention Disclosures, Patent Families, Patents
â¢ Trademark Search Requests, Trademark Families, Trademarks, Third Party Trademarks
â¢ Conflicts
â¢ Contracts
â¢ Domain Names
â¢ General Matters
Cost Object
âª Cost is a custom object (on page 539).
âª Cost records include Cost Date, Cost Amount, and Cost Description fields plus categorization fields like Cost 
Category and Cost Type.
âª Cost records can also be associated with invoices and vendors.
Import Specifications
âª You can insert cost records initially and update or upsert them if needed. See insert, update, or âupsertâ (on page
539).
âª You can add a field to the cost object to make updating costs easier. (Unique Cost ID for example.)
Reference Field
Costs are shared with multiple objects (listed above). Cost records include a lookup field to each of these objects. If
your import includes links to more than one object, you could include a column for each.
Page 543
| 15 - System Administration
However, using our custom Reference field is typically easier. Instead of creating multiple columns, create a single
column called Reference. Populate Reference with a record name from any valid lookup object. IPfolio associates
the imported cost record with the correct object automatically.
Note: Costs include other lookup fields like Vendor and Invoice too. Make sure the records referenced in
lookup fields exist before importing costs.

Exporting Data
Salesforce provides a variety of options for exporting data.
Reports
Reports (on page 496) are the easiest way to export data. While not suitable for a full backup, you can use reports
to do limited, ad-hoc backups. For example, you may choose to generate a Contacts report and export the results
before changing Contact records.
Image Export to Microsoft Excel
When preparing Microsoft Excel reports containing images, such as Trademark or Trademark Family reports, it is
recommended to use the IMAGE function provided by Microsoft Excel (please click herefor details).
Use a formula field that leverages the Content Download URL field on the Trademark and Trademark Family
objects, and the image will be a public link that is accessible from everywhere.
You can use this formula, for example:
Please note that Microsoft Excel does not recognize formulas like the one above immediately. You will need to
export the report in CSV format, and import into Microsoft Excel - the formula will render correctly then.
Data Loader and dataloader.io
In addition to importing data, both Data Loader (on page 538) and dataloader.io (on page 538) can be used to 
export data.
Weekly Export Service
Setup Quick Find Data Management Data Export
The Weekly Export Service lets you perform a complete backup of all IPfolio data, including documents.
âª You can schedule exports to run weekly or run ad-hoc exports (one per week.)
âª Weekly Export Service lets you export some or all of your data.
âª When the export is complete, you receive an email with a link you use to download the file(s).
Page 546
IPfolio User Guide
âª The export files are only available for 48 hours, after which they are deleted.
âª Unlike the other services, Data Export is intended to provide a full backup of all IPfolio data.
Note: Backups are important. Please work with your IT group to create an appropriate backup program.
See Export Backup Data from Salesforcefor more information.
Business Logic Execution Tool
The Business Logic Execution Tool lets you reapply IPfolio business logic to update data on select records.
Warning: Please see Before You Start (on page 531).
IPfolio Business Logic
IPfolio sometimes adds and updates data for you. For example, when you create a first filed patent from an invention
disclosure:
âª Fields like Title are copied from the disclosure to the new patent record.
âª Fields like Status (Prosecution) and Maximum Term are automatically updated by IPfolio custom code.
âª Fields like Standard Expiration Date are automatically updated by processes, flows, or workflows.
âª Fields like IDF - Submitted By are formula fields that simply display a value from a related record.
âª Fields like All Inventors are updated by custom logic that summarizes data from related records.
We use the term âIPfolio Business Logicâ generically to describe the logic and methods used to update data.
Note:
Data is added and updated in other ways too:
âª Fields like Filing Data and Application Number are typically added manually.
âª Data is often imported (especially during implementation).
âª Date is populated from external sources by IPsync and other services.
Common Issues
Most of the time, IPfolio can update your records without manual intervention. However, there are times when
manual intervention is required to fix data on your records.
This can happen when:
Page 547
| 15 - System Administration
âª IPfolio is missing field values required to calculate other field values. For example, our Maximum Term
calculation is based on the Standard Expiration Date. If it is missing, we canât calculate Maximum Term.
âª Data exists, but it was added later than expected. For example, we copy the Title and other field values from 
the invention disclosures to the patent when the patent is created. If these fields are populated later, they are not
copied to the patent.
We add and update data without issue most of the time. However, there are times when manual intervention may be
required, and using the Business Logic Execution Tool to reapply IPfolio business logic to select records can help.
Note: Records created in IPfolio tend to have fewer problems than imported records, in part because we
check for errors as you work. Imported records are more likely to have missing or invalid values, or contains
illogical value combinations.
How It Works
The Business Logic Execution Tool lets you reapply IPfolio business logic to update data on select records.
1. Open the Business Logic Execution Tool from the App Launcher, select an object â e.g., Patent(for your
convenience, the objects are arranged alphabetically), and click Next.
2. Choose business logic to run â e.g., Recalculate Maximum Term, and click Next.
3. Select the records to apply the business logic to â e.g., US patents or Issued patents, and click Next.
4. With the selections complete, run the updates by clicking Start Batch.
Sample Update
During an audit, you notice recently imported Belgian patents are missing Standard Expiration Date and Maximum 
Term values. Other bibliographic fields appear to be correct. You decide to use the Business Logic Execution Tool to
calculate the missing Standard Expiration Date and Maximum Term values.
Page 548
IPfolio User Guide
Since Standard Expiration Date is required to calculate Maximum Term, you run the Business Logic Execution Tool
twice:
1. First to calculate Standard Expiration Date.
2. Then to calculate Maximum Term.
Note: There are other times when running the Business Logic Execution Tool more than once is required.
For example, for multi-generational families (parents, grandparents, etc.) you may need to fix data one
âgenerationâ at a time.
1. Calculate Standard Expiration Date.
a. Open the Business Logic Execution Tool from the App Launcher and select an object - in this
case, Patent.
b. Choose business logic to run: Standard Expiration Date is calculated using a Process Builder 
âprocessâ. This is run by selecting Rerun processes, flows and workflows.
c. Provide a field condition: Use field conditions to apply business logic to a subset of records from
the selected object. We use the Salesforce SOQLlanguage to query records. The Insert field and 
Page 549
| 15 - System Administration
Insert operator fields make it easier to build the query. To select Belgian patents, select patents
where Country Code is equal to BE.
d. With the selections complete, run the updates by clicking Start 
Batch.
2. Calculate Maximum Term: Rerun the Business Logic Execution Tool. Use the same settings as above, but
this time select Recalculate Maximum Term.

Note: All objects also include an Update without change option that runs âunselectiveâ business
logic. Examples include calculating First Filing Date on invention disclosures and recalculating Status 
(Prosecution) on patents.
Example: Updating PCT Application Number and PCT Filing Date Using BLET
Use the Business Logic Execution Tool to update the PCT Application Number and PCT Filing Date on WO 
descendants.
Normally, the system sets the PCT Application Number and PCT Filing Date to the value of the WO ancestor on 
WO descendants that are not WOs themselves. The system does this automatically, but it is possible for the values
to be incorrect. For example, they can be set improperly during data imports.
You can use the Business Logic Execution Tool to âbackfillâ these values.
1. Open the Business Logic Execution Tool from the App Launcher.
2. Select an object: Patent.
3. Choose business logic to run: Propagate prosecution fields from WO/EPs to children.
4. Provide a field condition: Enter the following SOQL query to select the correct records.

Type Checkbox
Select to use EmployeeID for matching personal information objects. For example, to show the right IDFs to the
current portal user, use their EmployeeID (and not their email address) to search existing Inventor IDF records.
There are times when IPfolio needs to find a matching Contact, User, or Party record for a user. For example, when
creating a patent from an IDF, IPfolio checks if the IDF inventor has a party record, and creates one if they donât.
Historically, we have used an email address to match records. However, email addresses can change over time, and
when they do, it can create problems.
Use EmployeeID for matching provides you with an alternative to matching by email.
That said, itâs important to note that EmployeeIDs can change too. Furthermore, EmployeeID may not be in the data
you get from HR. Generally speaking, use the field with values that are least likely to change over time.

Field Types
âAllâ Field
In IPfolio, one record can be related to many records of another type. IPfolio shows the âmanyâ records in a Related 
List. Related lists work well but have limitations. For example, by default, itâs hard to show a simple list of inventor
names on a patent record.
IPfolio solves this problem with âAllâ fields. âAllâ fields summarize data from related records in a simple text field.
This text field can be used in places the actual related records canât. For example, the patent All Inventors field can 
be added to the patent page layout.
Figure 75. All Inventors Field on Patent
Note: Many âAllâ fields have a âshortâ version too. For example, patents have an All Inventors field and an All 
Inventors (Short) field. They have the same data, but the âshortâ version is truncated at 255 characters. Use
the short version in List Views, Reports, Compact Layouts, and in formulas.
Real-time Updates
IPfolio updates the âAllâ fields as you edit related records. For example:
âª IPfolio updates All Inventors on patents when you add/delete/edit the Inventors related list.
âª IPfolio updates All Categories on the related record when you update the category tree.
Important: Populated by IPfolio. Do not update manually.
Scheduled/Manual Updates
Updating âAllâ fields as you edit records keeps most âAllâ fields up-to-date. However, they can get out-of-sync, for
example after data imports. To ensure ensure âAllâ fields are correct:
âª IPfolio updates âAllâ fields on active records during nightly checks.
âª You can update âAllâ fields manually using the Business Logic Execution Tool (on page 547).
Summary
âª IPfolio uses related lists to model one-to-many relationships.
âª âAllâ fields summarize data from related records in a simple text field.
âª IPfolio keeps âAllâ fields up-to-date as you edit records. We also update âAllâ fields on active records nightly.
Page 582
IPfolio User Guide
Checkbox
Allows users to check a box, indicating a true or false attribute of a record. When using a checkbox field for a report
or list view filter, use âTrueâ for checked values and âFalseâ for unchecked values. The Data Import Wizard and the
weekly export tool use â1â for checked values and â0â for unchecked values.
Currency
Allows users to enter a currency amount. The system automatically formats the field as a currency amount. This 
formatting is useful if you export data to a spreadsheet application. Not available for external objects.
Date
Allows users to enter a date or pick a date from a popup calendar. In reports, you can limit the data by specific dates
using any custom date field.
Date/Time
Allows users to enter a date or pick a date from a popup calendar and enter a time of day.
There are visual and behavioral differences for Date/Time fields in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic.
âª In Lightning Experience, the date and time fields are separate, and the initial time is set to 12:00 PM when you
select a date in the calendar.
âª In Salesforce Classic, the date/time field is a single field. You can set the field to the current date and time by
clicking the date and time link next to the field. The time of day includes AM or PM notation.
In reports, you can limit the data by specific dates and times using any custom date field.
Notes
âª Date/Time fields always show both date and time.
âª To see only the date for a managed date/time field, create a local formula field of type Date that reflects the
value of the packaged field.
Email
Allows users to enter an email address of up to 80 characters, which is validated to ensure proper format. If this field
is specified for contacts or leads, users can choose the address when clicking Send an Email.
You canât use custom email addresses for mass emails or list emails.
Emails sent to a recordâs custom email address fields arenât logged against that record.
Formula
Allows users to automatically calculate values based on other values or fields such as merge fields. The data type of 
a formula determines the type of data you expect returned from your formula.
âª Formula fields are rendered in real-time. (For example, when you view a record or run a report.)
âª They canât be used to trigger a workflow or process.
Long Text Area
Allows users to enter up to 131,072 characters that display on separate lines similar to a Description field.
Page 583
| 15 - System Administration
You can set the length of this field type to a lower limit, if desired.
âª Any length from 256 to 131,072 characters is allowed.
âª The default is 32,768 characters.
Every time you press Enter within a long text area field, a line break, and a return character are added to the text.
These two characters count toward the 131,072 character limit.
This data type is not available for activities or products on opportunities.
The first 999 characters in a standard rich text area or a long text area are displayed in a report. For custom fields,
only the first 255 characters are displayed.
Other Limitations
Long Text fields canât be used in:
âª Formulas
âª Compact Layouts
âª History Tracking
Furthermore there are limitations with filtering and searching in Reports.
Lookup
Creates a relationship between two records so you can associate them with each other.
On a standard or custom object, a lookup relationship creates a field that allows users to click a lookup icon and 
select another record from a popup window.
âª On an external object, the lookup relationship field references 18-character Salesforce IDs that are stored in an
external data source. Those IDs are matched against the parent object to determine which records are related
to each other.
âª On the parent record, you can display a related list to show all the records that are linked to it. You can create
lookup relationship fields that link to users, standard objects, or custom objects. If a lookup field references a 
record that has been deleted, Salesforce clears the value of the lookup field by default. Alternatively, you can
choose to prevent records from being deleted if theyâre in a lookup relationship.
Number
Allows users to enter any number. This number is treated as a real number and any leading zeros are removed.
âNumber (5,0)â represents a field that can hold a five digit number, with zero decimal places.
Percent
Allows users to enter a percentage number as a decimalâfor example, 0.10. The system automatically converts the
decimal to a percentage. For example, 10%.
Phone
Allows users to enter any phone number. Character limit is 40.
Salesforce automatically formats it as a phone number.
Page 584
IPfolio User Guide
If you are using Salesforce CRM Call Center, custom phone fields are displayed with the Click-to-dial button,
allowing click-to-dial functionality. Therefore, Salesforce recommends that you do not use a custom phone field for
fax numbers.
Picklist
Lets users select a single value from a list that you define.
Rich Text
With the use of a toolbar, users can format the field content and add images and hyperlinks. The toolbar allows the
user to undo, redo, bold, italicize, underline, strike-out, add a hyperlink, upload or link to an image, modify alignment,
add a numbered or non-numbered list, indent, and outdent.
âª The maximum field size is 131,072 characters, inclusive of all the formatting and HTML tags.
âª The first 999 characters in a standard rich text area or a long text area are displayed in a report.
âª For custom fields, only the first 255 characters are displayed.
âª The maximum size for uploaded images is 1 MB.
âª Only gif, jpeg, and png file types are supported.
âª Not available for external objects.
âª There are visual and formatting differences for rich text areas in Lightning Experience and the Salesforce app,
compared to Salesforce Classic.
Roll-Up Summary
Automatically displays the record count of related records or calculates the sum, minimum, or maximum value
of related records. The records must be directly related to the selected record and on the detail side of a custom 
master-detail relationship with the object that contains the roll-up summary field.
Text Area
Allows users to enter up to 255 characters that display on separate lines similar to a Description field.
Text
Allows users to enter any combination of letters, numbers, or symbols. You can set a maximum length, up to 255
characters.
URL
Allows users to enter up to 255 characters of any valid website address. Only the first 50 characters are displayed
on the record detail pages.
âª In Classic, the URL opens in a separate browser window.
âª In Lightning, internal URLs open in the same window and external URLs open in a separate browser window.
âª In Salesforce console apps, the URL opens in a new workspace tab.
âª In Lightning console apps, internal URLs open in a new workspace tab and external URLs open in a separate
browser window.

Reference
API Name IPfolio__Reference__c
Type Text
Reference is a special field used to link costs to records of different types. It is especially helpful when importing cost 
records, especially when the cost records are associated with more than one type of record.
Background
The Cost object is linked to Patents, Trademarks, General Matters and other âprimaryâ objects.
When importing costs, you include cost details, and tell IPfolio which record to associate the cost with. You do this
by entering the name of the record in the correct Lookup field. For example, to import a patent cost, you include the
cost details and import the name of the patent (âP-001â) in the patent Lookup field.
If you only import patent costs, this approach works well.
However, when you import costs associated with more than one object, especially in same import, it gets trickier.
You need to include the cost data, and a lookup field for each type of object. For example, if you were importing cost
records for patents and trademarks, you would need a lookup field for each, and you would need to ensure right
record names were in the right lookup fields. The more record types you have, the trickier this gets.
Reference simplifies this.
For example, if you were importing two cost records (one for patents and one for trademarks), you would include
the cost details for each, and add both names (âP-001â and âTM-001â) into Reference.
Table: Sample Cost Import File
Reference Date Amount
P-001 2/1/2020 100
TM-001 2/2/2020 100
IPfolio takes care of finding the right record to associate the cost with.
Note:
If IPfolio canât find a match, the cost is still imported. Consider creating a report to help find and correct
these records.
Also, consider creating a unique key when importing cost records. This makes it easier to update costs later
if needed.

IP ONE Data assigns a score of Low/Medium/High to express its confidence that it has identified the correct record.
This score determines how IP ONE Data handles data from the matched record:
âª High: Like with IPsync, values will be written immediately into empty fields in IPfolio (unless the field is included
in the Always Create Sync Log field set), and Sync Logs are created for discrepancies (i.e. there is already an
existing value in IPfolio).
âª Medium: a Data Audit (Sync Log) will always be generated, just like for any fields that are configured in the
Always Create Sync Log field set.
âª Low: no data will be written and no Sync Log created. The matching attempt is only logged in the IP ONE Sync
Details object.
Note: The Confidence of Match score (High/Medium/Low) expresses confidence in the match, NOT the
accuracy of the data on either record.

Patent(s) Filed / Patent(s) Issued
The Invention Disclosure Status is not intended to be an overview of the current status of all related patents (like it
is on a Patent Family). Instead, a Status of âPatent(s) Filedâ or âPatent(s) Issuedâ indicates the disclosure led to one
or more filed or issued patents.
âª If the related patent is filed or issued, Status is updated to reflect that fact.
âª If the related patent is later lapsed, sold, or closed, the Invention Disclosure Status is not updated.

IPfolio User Guide
A unique ID from the external system that generated the invoice. An External ID makes it possible to update existing
invoice records via imports.
You can use the import feature to bulk add or bulk update Invoice records.
To bulk update existing records via import, you need to tell IPfolio which records to update. Normally, you include
a Salesforce ID or Name value for each record in the import .csv. IPfolio uses this value to find and update the 
correct record. You can use a different unique ID if these values arenât available.
To use a different unique ID:
âª Pick a suitable unique ID field to export, and export it with the invoice data.
âª Import the unique ID into the "External ID" field on the Invoice object. (The "External ID" field has special
properties that make it usable for imports.)
Later, if you need to update your IPfolio invoice records:
âª Export your updated Invoice records. Make sure to include the unique ID.
âª Import the records into IPfolio, selecting "Update" or "Upsert".
âª When prompted, choose "External ID" as the match field.

Numeric value indicating the confidence score. Possible values are:
â¢ 100 - Low confidence match
â¢ 200 - Medium confidence match
â¢ 301 - Medium confidence match handling special cases of AU jurisdiction grant date mismatches
â¢ 400 - High confidence match
Confidence of Match
API Name IPfolio__Confidence_Rating__c
Type Text
IP ONE Data assigns a score of Low/Medium/High to express its confidence that it has identified the correct record.
This score determines how IP ONE Data handles data from the matched record:
Page 724
IPfolio User Guide
âª High: Like with IPsync, values will be written immediately into empty fields in IPfolio (unless the field is included
in the Always Create Sync Log field set), and Sync Logs are created for discrepancies (i.e. there is already an
existing value in IPfolio).
âª Medium: a Data Audit (Sync Log) will always be generated, just like for any fields that are configured in the
Always Create Sync Log field set.
âª Low: no data will be written and no Sync Log created. The matching attempt is only logged in the IP ONE Sync
Details object.
The algorithm used to determine Confidence of Match is proprietary. Generally speaking:
âª The Application Number, Publication Number, and Grant Number are compared to ensure we are matching the
right case. If any are missing, this will negatively impact the confidence of the match.
âª The Filing Date, Publication Date, and Grant Date are compared and results increase or decrease the confidence
of a match. If none are provided, the best case is Medium confidence.
âª Title and inventor are also compared and results can increase or decrease the confidence of a match, but with a
lesser impact.
Note:
The Confidence of Match score (High/Medium/Low) expresses confidence in the match, NOT the accuracy
of the data on either record.
In case the score increases from Medium to High, due to new data that came in through a different feed, any
Data Audits that are no longer necessary given the highest Confidence score will be invalidated.

When adding Date Sold:
âª Status (High-Level) (on page 788) changes to âSoldâ.
âª Status (Prosecution) (on page 790) does not change.
Note: In practice, most patents sold are issued. If the patent sold is pending, it typically drops off the sellerâs
Patent Center Customer Number and the seller no longer sees updates in their system (since the buyer
takes over prosecution). Therefore, when adding Date Sold, Status (Prosecution) doesnât change. Instead,
Status (Prosecution) reflects the status at the time the asset was sold, which is useful historical information.

Extended Family
API Name IPfolio__Extended_Family__c
Type Lookup
An âextended familyâ is a way to indicate that patents in separate families are closely related. More specifically, that
the ideas from which they come are conceptually similar.
For example, if a customer creates a filing from IDF-001:
âª Patent Family P001 is created.
âª Patent P001-US is created.
Later, if the customer creates a filing from IDF-002:
Page 755
| 15 - System Administration
âª Patent Family P002 is created.
âª Patent P002-US is created.
If IDF-001 and IDF-002 are conceptually similar, patents P001-US and P002-US are likely similar.
Historically, weâve used a single field, Patent Family, that groups patents by family (and indirectly by invention
disclosure), but, there is no easy way to know if patents P001-US and P002-US are similar.
The new patent field, Extended Family, makes this possible.
From the example above, if all patents in both families have a value of âP001â in the Extended Family field, running 
a report with all patents where Extended Family is âP001â would return all patents from both families. IPfolio 
business logic auto-populates the Extended Family field on for all patents in family when certain conditions art met.
Note: The feature does not change how patent families work. Extended Family is a new patent field that 
some customers may find helpful.
How It Works
Extended Family is a new (Patent Family) lookup field on patents.
âª We auto-populate Extended Family during record creation.
âª Extended Family gets the same value as Patent Family to start.
âª Our business logic updates Extended Family when specific conditions (below) are met.
âª Customers can use Extended Family in reports and elsewhere.
Update Logic
Extended Family starts with the same value as Patent Family.
IPfolio updates Extended Family on all members of a patent family where one patent has been terminally 
disclaimed by a patent of an earlier family. We set Extended Family to the earlier family.
âª We query all members of the family of the current patent (patents where Patent Family =
IP_Right_Parent__r.IP_Right__r.Invention__c)
âª On these records, we set the Extended Family to the parent patentâs family.

Different jurisdictions define âfiling dateâ differently. IPfolio populates Filing Date as follows:
US:
âª For National Stage, Filing Date = International Filing Date as defined by the USPTO.
âª For all other matter types, Filing Date = 371 Filing Date of the Divisional, CIP, CON, etc.
Outside the US:
âª For all subsequent filings (i.e. Divisionals, National/Regional), Filing Date = Deemed/Effective Filing Date
(immediate parentâs filing date).
âª The Divisional/National/Regional filing date should be entered into the Local Filing Date field.

Lapse Date
API Name IPfolio__Lapse_Date__c
Type Date
Page 764
IPfolio User Guide
Populated 
By
IPfolio (IPsync)
The date the patent ceases to be in force, due to expiring or non-renewal. Adding Lapse Date changes Status (HighLevel) (on page 788) to âLapsedâ and Status (Prosecution) (on page 790) to âExpiredâ/âAbandonedâ.
Lapse Date is included with IPsync. For eligible records, IPfolio compares Lapse Date with external data and creates
Data Audits when discrepancies are found.
The correct Lapse Date is important:
âª Lapse Date affects instructions sent to the annuity service provider. Mistakes can result in unnecessary charges
or missed payments.
âª Lapse Date is used to set the patent status. With an inaccurate Lapse Date, Lapsed patents can show as âIn
Forceâ, and In Force patents can show as âLapsedâ.
For these reasons, we think itâs important for you to enter the Lapse Date.
We help by proposing a Lapse Date using Data Audits when possible. Data Audits let you âAcceptâ or âDiscardâ our
proposed Lapse Date.
We create a Data Audit proposing a Lapse Date in the following scenarios:
Maximum Term
We propose a Lapse Date equal to Maximum Term, when Maximum Term has passed.
Notice of Abandonment
We propose a Lapse Date equal to the Action Date, when an action with Action Code âABNâ is created.
Note: This works whether the action is created by IPsync or created manually.
Application Status Details
We propose a Lapse Date equal to the Application Status Date, when the patent Status Text(Detailed) contains 
âabandonedâ or âexpiredâ.
Note: In Patent Center Private View (former Private PAIR), the USPTO includes the current status of the
application.
âª For IPsync customers, we use the current status (and the corresponding date) to populate the Status Text
(Detailed) and Application Status Date fields on patents.
âª Since Status Text (Detailed) and Application Status Date are populated by IPsync, IPsync customers are the
primary beneficiaries in this scenario.

API Name IPfolio__Patent_Strength_Indicator__c
Type Number
Populated 
By
IPfolio (IP One)
IP One Data includes Innographyâs PatentStrengthâ¢ score (found in the Patent Strength Indicator field on patents). 
PatentStrengthâ¢ is an algorithmic estimate of âstrengthâ and provides a predictive indicator for a patentâs likelihood
of being involved with litigation.
âª This involves complex regression analysis on over 30 attributes of patents that have been litigated versus
patents that have not been litigated.
âª The predictive algorithm computes sensitivities and their weightings based on the most significant factors that
are helpful in forecasting litigation.
âª It is based upon research showing certain patent factors are predictors of future litigation, such as counts of 
claims, references, etc.
âª Forward citations are a strong influencing factor, and they are weighted to reduce bias for âolderâ vs. more
recent patents.
âª A score of 70 and higher is generally considered âstrong.â

Status (Prosecution) Logic
Details
âª IPfolio checks the conditions in order and sets Status (Prosecution) to the value of the first matching condition.
âª Setting Status (Prosecution) to âNo Further Actionâ disables further updates.
âª Fields in bold accept future dates. The status changes after the date entered.
Patent Sold
The Status (Prosecution) logic doesnât include a âPatent Soldâ condition so Status (Prosecution) doesnât change
when a patent is sold. See Date Sold (on page 746) for details.
Custom Statuses
âª You can change the label of the âApproved for Filingâ picklist value.
âª You can create and use one or more custom statuses, with the following caveat:
Important:
Early-stage, âpre-prosecutionâ custom statuses (like âIn Committee Reviewâ) work best.
Remember, IPfolio checks conditions in order, and we check for bibliographic data before we check for 
custom statuses. If a record has bibliographic data our logic finds it, sets the status, and exits before even
considering your custom status. See the logic above for details.
Bulk Update Values
IPfolio keeps Status (Prosecution) up-to-date automatically. You can use the Business Logic Execution Tool (on page

Many countries have "export control"laws that restrict non-nationals from accessing technical documents, like
those found in patent applications. The patent team is required to limit access to these files until these restrictions 
are removed. (The application is published, issued, or a "foreign filing license"is obtained).
Selecting Subject to Export Control on a patent limits access to the files in Documents to select IPfolio users. Only 
users associated with the country listed in the Country field can open these files. Other users cannot open these 
files.
To associate a user with a country, add them to the appropriate Chatter group. For example, to enable a user to

A Patent Family is a collection of patents, each with its own status. The logic used to assign a status to the family is
open to interpretation. IPfolio sets Family Status as follows (recalculating it both in case of the status change of the 
patents already related to the Patent Family, and if new ones are linked to it):
1. If at least one family member is In Force, the family is âIn Forceâ
2. If at least one member is Pending, the family is âPendingâ
3. If at least one member is Expiring, the family is âExpiringâ
Page 801
| 15 - System Administration
4. If all family members are Not Filed, the family is âNot Filedâ
5. If all members are Not Filed or Finally Lapsed, the family is âFinally Lapsedâ
6. If all members are Not Filed or Lapsed or Finally Lapsed, the family is âLapsedâ
7. If all members are Not Filed or Closed, the family is âClosedâ
8. If all members are Not Filed or Sold, the family is âSoldâ
9. Else the family is âClosedâ
Rationale
The following are the âmost aliveâ statuses. A single family member with one of these statuses is sufficient to
consider the family âIn Forceâ.
âª In Force is the âmost aliveâ status.
âª Pending is the next âmost aliveâ status.
âª Expiring is a âsemi-aliveâ status.
The following statuses are considered âdeadâ:
âª Nothing was ever filed â âNot Filedâ for the family
âª Everything that was ever filed is now Finally Lapsed â âFinally Lapsedâ for the family
âª Everything that was ever filed is now Lapsed (including Finally Lapsed) â âLapsedâ for the family. It is Lapsed, but
not Finally Lapsed yet.
âª Everything that was ever filed is now Closed â âClosedâ for the family
âª Everything that was ever filed is now Sold â âSoldâ for the family
âª For any mix of âdeadâ statuses, we choose the generic âClosedâ

IPfolio User Guide
âª When the record Owner on a Patent/Trademark/Invention Disclosure is changed, all open tasks that are
Assigned To / Owned by the old record Owner are re-assigned to the new record Owner. Closed tasks and open
tasks not assigned to the old record Owner are not reassigned to the new Owner.
âª If the Firm Attorney field on the related record is empty, workflow-created tasks are Assigned To the user
whose email matches the Law Firm email address. In other words, IPfolio first assigns the task to the user who
owns the Firm Attorney email, and if the Firm Attorney email address is missing, falls back to the user who owns
the generic Law Firm email address. This way, the user who owns the generic email of the Law Firm gets notified
and can assign the task to the right person.
âª Whenever a task is Assigned To a user whose user name contains âsystemâ, IPfolio looks up the user with the
email address of the Firm Attorney on the record, and assigns the task to that user.

A Trademark Family is a collection of trademarks, each with its own status. The logic used to assign a status to the
family is open to interpretation. IPfolio sets Family Status as follows:
Logic
1. If at least one family member is In Force, the family is âIn Forceâ
2. Else if at least one member is Pending, the family is âPendingâ
3. Else if at least one member is Expiring, the family is âExpiringâ
4. Else if all family members are Not Filed, the Family is âNot Filedâ
5. Else if all members are either Not Filed or Finally Lapsed, the Family is âFinally Lapsedâ
6. Else if all members are either Not Filed or Lapsed or Finally Lapsed, the family is âLapsedâ
7. Else if all members are either Not Filed or Closed, the family is âClosedâ
8. Else if all members are either Not Filed or Sold, the family is âSoldâ
9. Else the family is âClosedâ
Rationale
The following are the âmost aliveâ statuses. A single family member with one of these statuses is sufficient to
consider the family âIn Forceâ.
Page 880
IPfolio User Guide
âª In Force is the âmost aliveâ status.
âª Pending is the next âmost aliveâ status.
âª Expiring is a âsemi-aliveâ status.
